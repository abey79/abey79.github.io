      <description>I originally intended vpype 1.10 to be a &amp;lsquo;quick-and-dirty&amp;rsquo;, bug-fix-only release but it ended up being quite substantial, so let&amp;rsquo;s dive in.
New features and improvements   Improved support for layer pen width and opacity in the viewer (#448)
 The &amp;ldquo;Pen Width&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Pen Opacity&amp;rdquo; menus are now named &amp;ldquo;Default Pen Width&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Default Pen Opacity&amp;rdquo;. The layer opacity is now used for display by default. It can be overridden by the default pen opacity by checking the &amp;ldquo;Override&amp;rdquo; item from the &amp;ldquo;Default Pen Opacity&amp;rdquo; menu.</description>

      <description>When I started using my new M1 Max MacBook Pro in December, a bunch of vpype&amp;rsquo;s tests started to fail. The failing tests were all image-based: an image is rendered and then compared to a previously-generated, reference image. This process is made easy thanks to this Pytest fixture.
In this case, the reference images were generated long ago on my previous, Intel/AMD-based MacBook Pro. This GIF highlights the discrepancy I&amp;rsquo;d get with images generated on my new computer (notice how the ruler&amp;rsquo;s thickness varies):</description>

      <title>Annotated Release Notes: vpype 1.9</title>

      <description>vpype 1.9 is finally out! ðŸŽ‰
I recently stumbled upon a post by Simon Willison where he promotes the idea of annotated release notes. As it turns out, this release is, by any metric I can think of, the biggest and most transformative so far. The associated change log is consequently rather unwieldy and calls, you guessed it ðŸ’¡, for the present annotated release notes.
(Note: although the original release notes are extensively quoted in this article, I reshuffled and shortened the original material.</description>

      <description>My name is Antoine Beyeler. I am a multi-disciplinary engineer and entrepreneur with a PhD in flying robotics and interests in software, aviation, photography, generative art, plotters, and home automation. I live in Lausanne, Switzerland ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­.
With a few friends, I co-founded senseFly in 2009, which soon became the leader of fixed-wing mapping drones for surveyors, farmers, humanitarians and many others. Until my departure in 2018, I lead as CTO a team of up to 45 engineers and developed multiple generations of end-to-end mapping drone systems.</description>
