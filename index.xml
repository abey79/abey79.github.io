      <description>vpype 1.9 is finally out! ðŸŽ‰
I recently stumbled upon a post by Simon Willison where he promotes the idea of annotated release notes. As it turns out, this release is, by any metric I can think of, the biggest and most transformative so far. The associated change log is consequently rather unwieldy and calls, you guessed it ðŸ’¡, for the present annotated release notes.
(Note: although the original release notes are extensively quoted in this article, I reshuffled and shortened the original material.</description>

      <description>My name is Antoine Beyeler. I am a multi-disciplinary engineer and entrepreneur with a PhD in flying robotics and interests in software, aviation, photography, generative art, plotters, and home automation. I live in Lausanne, Switzerland ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­.
With a few friends, I co-founded senseFly in 2009, which soon became the leader of fixed-wing mapping drones for surveyors, farmers, humanitarians and many others. Until my departure in 2018, I lead as CTO a team of up to 45 engineers and developed multiple generations of end-to-end mapping drone systems.</description>
