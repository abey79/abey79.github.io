My name is **Antoine Beyeler**. I am a multi-disciplinary engineer and entrepreneur with a PhD in flying robotics and interests in software, aviation, photography, generative art, plotters, and home automation. I live in Lausanne, Switzerland :flag_ch:.

With a few friends, I co-founded [senseFly](https://www.sensefly.com) in 2009, which soon became the leader of fixed-wing mapping drones for surveyors, farmers, humanitarians and many others. Until my departure in 2018, I lead as CTO a team of up to 45 engineers and developed multiple generations of end-to-end mapping drone systems. I am now involved in advisory capacity with several start-ups in the Geneva region.

Like my skills, my contributions to generative art lean on the technical rather than the artistic side :man_technologist:. Among other things, I created and maintain two open-source projects for plotter generative artists:
* [_vpype_](https://github.com/abey79/vpype): a Swiss-Army-knife CLI to generate, manage, process, and convert vector graphic files for plotters,
* [_vsketch_](https://github.com/abey79/vsketch): a Python plotter generative art framework and workflow automation tool.

When I am not at the computer, you may find me piloting a helicopter :helicopter: or behind the camera :camera: on my travels.
