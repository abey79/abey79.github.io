Hello again, world.

<!--more--> 

Lately, I've been meaning to document some of my personal projects and endeavours, and realised that I lacked an appropriate outlet. I figured this would be great occasion to test [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), so here we are!

This is what might ramble about in the future: 

- Stuff about [vpype](https://github.com/abey79/vpype), [vsketch](https://github.com/abey79/vsketch), and my other plotter-related software projects.
- Logs for some of my past and future projects (plotter-related or otherwise).
- Posts related to [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) or other home-automation topics.
- Who knows what else.

Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/abey79) for updates.
