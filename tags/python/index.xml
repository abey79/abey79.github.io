      <description>Deep dive into the internals of my Automatic</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="whats-this">What&rsquo;s this?</h2>
<p>I recently built an &ldquo;Automatic #plotloop Machine&rdquo;, named after the common <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/plotloop">social</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/plotloop">media</a> hashtag for these animations made of individually plotted frames. This article is a thorough description of the project, covering both hardware and software aspects.</p>
<p>First, here is a video:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w_PPPImmEN8" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="The Automatic #plotloop Machine"></iframe>
</div>

<br/>
<p>So, this is all very nice, but why does this article need to be more than <em>six thousand five hundred word long</em>?! Sure, the machine&rsquo;s neat, but it&rsquo;s not like <em>everyone</em> wants to make one, right?</p>
<p>Well, in the making of this project, I found myself using a number of tools and techniques which, I think, might be of more general interest&mdash;that is, also for someone without aspirations for maximally complex animation production methods.</p>
<p>Rather than the seasoned maker, who might more efficiently fill knowledge gaps with a few targeted Google queries, I wrote this article for the many people in the plotter space with an artistic rather than technical background. I&rsquo;m hoping this article might provide some technical baggage to fuel their tinkering urge, which, being involved with plotters, they obviously have.</p>
<p>So, if any or all of the following topics sound like they might be useful, have a read!</p>
<ul>
<li>How to use a Raspberry Pi to automate things like taking pictures or controlling stepper motors?</li>
<li>How to mate a stepper motor with LEGO Technic contraptions?</li>
<li>How to efficiently control a RPi via ssh?</li>
<li>How to efficiently control a RPi using a web framework?</li>
<li>How to use <a href="https://github.com/abey79/vsketch"><em>vsketch</em></a> to produce plot loops (automated or otherwise)?</li>
<li>How to use <em>doit</em> to automate complex workflows?</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>This article is not a beginner tutorial either. A number of the topics covered here would, in tutorial form, warrant an even longer treatment by themselves. There should be enough information to understand how things work and understand the relevance of the tools I&rsquo;ve used. Actually applying them in a project may, however, require some more focused reading. Likewise, the code is what I&rsquo;d call &ldquo;project quality&rdquo;&mdash;it does the job, I&rsquo;m not too ashamed of it (mostly), but shouldn&rsquo;t be construed as top-notch, state-of-the-art, production-ready copy-paste material.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Here is how the setup looks like in on my <a href="https://youtu.be/kELtKbjg-fo">mobile plotting station</a>:</p>
<img src="/automatic-plotloop-machine/setup.jpg"alt="overview picture of my automated plotloop setup, including an AxiDraw, an 80-mm paper roll with a lego feeder powered by a stepper motor, a raspberry pi with its camera, and a portable video light"width="100%"style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"/>
<p>Here are the main components involved:</p>
<ol>
<li>An <a href="https://shop.evilmadscientist.com/908">AxiDraw SE/A3</a> from <a href="https://shop.evilmadscientist.com">Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories</a>, driven by a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/">Raspberry Pi 4</a> not visible in the picture (it&rsquo;s neatly installed in the lower section of the plotting station).</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/">Raspberry Pi 3</a> hooked to the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera/">High Quality Camera</a> module and a <a href="https://www.schmalzhaus.com/EasyDriver/">EasyDriver</a> stepper motor driver, held by a Manfrotto <a href="https://www.manfrotto.com/global/pump-cup-with-16mm-socket-241s/">241s Pump Cup</a> and <a href="https://www.manfrotto.com/global/photo-variable-friction-arm-with-interchangeable-1-4-attach-244mini/">244 Mini Friction Arm</a>.</li>
<li>An 80-mm paper feeder contraption made of <a href="https://www.lego.com/themes/technic">LEGO Technic</a> and a stepper motor.</li>
<li>A Manfrotto <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/761822-REG/Manfrotto_ML840H_Maxima_84_LED_Panel.htm">ML840H On-Camera LED light</a>, held by a couple of umbrella swivel adapters and a <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1175618-REG/phottix_ph86315_multi_clamp.html">Phottix Multi Clamp</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Clearly, having a bunch of photography-related gear around is convenient for this kind of project! 😄</p>
<p>Here is a schematics view of the same setup:</p>
<img src="/automatic-plotloop-machine/schematic.png"alt="schematic view of my automated plotloop setup"width="100%"style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"/>
<p>The most salient aspect is the use of two Raspberry Pis. This is entirely unnecessary&mdash;a single RPi would be entirely sufficient. This arrangement happened to be more convenient for me because my plotting station already includes a RPi (with hostname <code>axidraw.local</code>) for my day-to-day use of the AxiDraw.</p>
<p>Missing from both pictures is my computer, which I use to generate the frames and controls the plotting process by sending orders to both RPis via Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>In the next sections, I will dig into the details of many hardware and software aspects of this setup, culminating with the <a href="https://pydoit.org"><em>doit</em></a> script which orchestrates everything ranging from generating the frame data, creating a simulated animation, controlling both RPis for plotting and picture acquisition, and assembling the final GIF:</p>
<img src="/automatic-plotloop-machine/world_final.gif"alt="animated GIF of a rotating earth, automatically plotted with my machine"width="532px"style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"/>
<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<h3 id="camera">Camera</h3>
<img src="/automatic-plotloop-machine/campi.png"alt="detail view of the raspberry pi with its camera and stepper motor controller"width="100%"style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"/>
<p>The camera assembly includes a Raspberry Pi (with hostname <code>campi.local</code>), the camera module and its optics, as well as the stepper motor driver. The three boards are assembled together using custom-cut plexiglass plates and nylon spacers. The camera module is connected to the RPi&rsquo;s camera interface using the provided 200mm ribbon cable.</p>
<p>I chose the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera/">High Quality Camera</a> for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is made by the Raspberry Pi Foundation itself, so it has best-in-class software support out-of-the-box.</li>
<li>With 12 megapixels and a large pixel size, it is one of the highest quality camera available for the Raspberry Pi.</li>
<li>It uses interchangeable, C-mount lenses, which means that I can use a lens that&rsquo;s best suited for this setup.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the lens, I selected the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16761">16mm telephoto</a>. With its relatively narrow field of view, it minimises the distortions and can be placed high enough to leave space for the plotter to operate. With this lens, the positioning is mainly driven by the minimum focus distance, which is approximately 24cm, measured from the front-most part of the lens.</p>
<p>Here is a sample frame and the corresponding raw image as taken by the camera (<a href="/automatic-plotloop-machine/sample_hires.jpg">high-res version</a>):</p>
<img src="/automatic-plotloop-machine/sample.png"alt="sample animation frame line-work with the corresponding raw image as taken by the camera"width="100%"style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"/>
<p>Note that the image is rotated by 90° compared to the actual frame. It just happened to be easier to set up the camera this way. It will be automatically corrected before the final animation is assembled.</p>
<h3 id="stepper-motor-driver">Stepper motor driver</h3>
<p>The <code>campi.local</code> RPi is also in charge of driving the paper feeder&rsquo;s stepper motor via an <a href="https://www.schmalzhaus.com/EasyDriver/">EasyDriver</a> board. As their name imply, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepper_motor">stepper motors</a> divide their full rotation into a number of discreet, equal steps. This makes them very convenient for use cases where accuracy and reproducibility is important, like 3D printers, plotters, and&hellip; makeshift paper feeders. Stepper drivers generate the high power electrical signals needed to run the motor based on a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_input/output">GPIO</a> inputs.</p>
<p>Here is a close-up of the wiring schematic:</p>
<img src="/automatic-plotloop-machine/stepper-driver.png"alt="wiring schematic of the raspberry pi, the EasyDriver stepper driver board, and the paper feeder stepper motor"height="400px"style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"/>
<p>The main inputs are STEP and DIR. The motor turns by one step for each STEP pulse (transition from 0 to 1), while the rotation direction is controlled by DIR.</p>
<p>The ENABLE input controls whether the motor outputs are powered or not. When they are, the driver actively keeps the motor in its position, which tends to heat both the driver and motor itself. As the feeder spends most its time waiting for the plotter to draw the frame, it is good idea to drive ENABLE only when actually running the feeder.</p>
<p>The MS1 and MS2 inputs control the so-called &ldquo;micro-stepping&rdquo; capability of the driver. This feature increases the accuracy of the motor by further dividing the motor&rsquo;s physical steps into up to 16 micro-steps. For a low-precision paper feeder like mine, this is not useful and the wiring can be skipped<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>One nice feature of the EasyDriver board is the ability to choose either 3.3V or 5V GPIO voltage. The default is 5V, but since the RPi uses 3.3V, I set the board to this voltage using a small solder bridge over the pads at the very bottom left of the board:</p>
<img src="/automatic-plotloop-machine/easydriver.png"alt="photograph of the EasyDriver stepper motor driver board"width="605"style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"/>
<h3 id="lego-structure">LEGO structure</h3>
<img src="/automatic-plotloop-machine/lego_feeder.jpg"alt="photograph of the LEGO feeder assembly"width="100%"style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"/>
<p>My LEGO building skills aren&rsquo;t anything to boast about&mdash;a skilled builder would likely do a much better job. Yet, my contraption turned out to work rather reliably thanks to a few key design decisions.</p>
<p>Most importantly, I wanted to leave the feeder &ldquo;open&rdquo; on the &ldquo;top&rdquo; side to minimise the chance of collision with the plotter or the pen during operations. The lower parallel structure is thus designed to maintain some rigidity between the paper roll part and the feed part. This actually worked much better that I anticipated!</p>
<p>These structures are really easy to build once your remember that 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup> = 5<sup>2</sup>:</p>
<img src="/automatic-plotloop-machine/lego_triangle.jpg"alt="photograph of a 3-4-5 right triangle made with LEGO Technic parts"width="60%"style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"/>
<p>All my diagonals use this arrangement and provide rigidity to the structure (purely rectangular structures are prone to parallelogram deformation).</p>
<p>Using the stepper motor weight to put pressure on the feeding wheel was another successful design. This ensured practically no paper slippage.</p>
<p>Finally, remembering that the LEGO stud pitch is 8mm, a 10-stud distance is a good fit for 80mm paper rolls. These are easy to source in office supply shops.</p>
<h3 id="stepper-lego-integration">Stepper-LEGO integration</h3>
<img src="/automatic-plotloop-machine/lego_motor.jpg"alt="close-up photograph of the motor-feeder lego assembly"width="60%"style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"/>
<p>One might wonder why I used a custom stepper motor instead of native LEGO motors to drive the feeder. The decision boils down to two issues with LEGO motors:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are no stepper-type LEGO motors, so their accuracy is not great, nor is their power.</li>
<li>Interfacing LEGO motors to a RPi is more complicated than using a stepper motor (especially if you already have stepper drivers lying around).</li>
</ol>
<p>I actually tried to use a LEGO Mindstorm motor initially. I used a <a href="https://www.dexterindustries.com/brickpi/">BrickPi</a> board to interface the motor to the RPi. It worked, but as noted above these motors are not ideal for the task and ended up not being precise and reliable enough.</p>
<p>An alternative to the BrickPi board would be to use the actual Mindstorm controller. This is not ideal though, as the controller is battery powered and must be tinkered with to accept external power. Also, the RPi must connect to it via Bluetooth, and a specific Python package must be used.</p>
<p>All in all, in my experience, using a stepper motor is just easier.</p>
<p>This begs the question of how to physically interface the stepper motor with LEGO Technic parts.</p>
<p>I used a 3D-printed adapter of <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5649176">my own design</a> to interface the 5mm axle of my motor to Technic axles. There are many such designs available online for various shapes and sizes of motor axles.</p>
<img src="/automatic-plotloop-machine/5mm_adapter.png"alt="closeup photograph and render of the 3d printed 5mm axle to LEGO Technic adapter"width="100%"style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"/>
<p>It turns out that physically assembling the motor with LEGO Technic is easy enough when using the <a href="https://reprap.org/wiki/NEMA_17_Stepper_motor">NEMA 17</a> form factor (one of the most commonly used by makers). The offset between their M3 attachments is 31mm. This is close enough to the 32mm offset between two 3-stud-apart Technic holes. Using conic screws easily takes up the remaining 1mm difference:</p>
<img src="/automatic-plotloop-machine/nema17_lego.jpg"alt="closeup photograph of how NEMA17 motor can be adapted to LEGO Technic"width="60%"style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"/>
<p>Crucially, this method keeps the motor axle properly aligned with the Technic grid.</p>
<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<h3 id="ssh-rpi">Setting up the Raspberry Pi for friction-less SSH</h3>
<p>There is ample <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/">documentation</a> available online on how to setup Raspberry Pis, which I won&rsquo;t reproduce here. I&rsquo;d like to focus instead on how to configure the RPi such as to minimise any friction when interacting with your RPi via SSH&mdash;either manually or automatically.</p>
<p>Here is what&rsquo;s needed to achieve this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unless you are using wired Ethernet, your home Wi-Fi must be configured on the RPi (of course, duh).</li>
<li>SSH must be configured for key-based authentication. This removes the need to input a password when SSHing into your RPi, which is annoying with manual operations and precludes automation.</li>
<li>ZeroConf/Bonjour/Avahi is installed and active. This means that you can connect to the RPi using a URL in the form of <code>hostname.local</code> instead of using an explicit IP address, which is hard to remember and subject to change.</li>
<li>You computer must &ldquo;know&rdquo; which username to use when connecting to a given RPi.</li>
</ol>
<p>For key-based authentication, you must first generate a public/private key pair on your computer (if you haven&rsquo;t done so already). This is done using the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">ssh-keygen
</code></pre></div><p>You&rsquo;ll need to answer a few questions, which can all be left as default. This will create two files in your home directory:</p>
<ul>
<li>The private key: <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa</code></li>
<li>The public key: <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code></li>
</ul>
<p>(Actual naming may differ depending on the type of key generated.)</p>
<p>The idea is to provide your <em>public</em> key (this is important&mdash;not the private key!) to the RPi so that it can accept connections without requesting a password when the originator possesses the corresponding private key.</p>
<p>Most of the configuration, fortunately, is addressed by the official <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/">Raspberry Pi Imager</a>, which I <em>strongly</em> suggest using. Everything can be set in the &ldquo;Advanced Options&rdquo; dialog, including the hostname, the SSH public key, and the Wi-Fi credentials:</p>
<img src="/automatic-plotloop-machine/rpi-imager.png"width="60%"style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"/>
<p>Again, note that the content of your <em>public</em> key (<code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code>) should be pasted in the relevant field.</p>
<p>Finally, you need to tell your computer&rsquo;s SSH that user <code>pi</code> (or whichever you chose) should be used by default when connecting to the given RPi. Create the <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file if needed, and add the following content:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-ssh-config" data-lang="ssh-config">Host axidraw.local
    User pi
</code></pre><p>This tells your computer&rsquo;s SSH to default to the username <code>pi</code> whenever it connects to <code>axidraw.local</code>.</p>
<p>If you already have a working RPi image, and you don&rsquo;t want to recreate one from scratch, you can do the same configurations manually as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check <a href="https://linuxhint.com/setup-wifi-raspberry-pi/">this article</a> for Wi-Fi configuration.</li>
<li>For key-based SSH authentication, create or edit the <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys2</code> file on the RPi and add the content of your public key on a new line.</li>
<li>Install ZeroConf/Bonjour/Avahi support with <code>sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon</code>.</li>
<li>Change the hostname by running <code>sudo raspi-config</code>. The configuration is in the Network Options menu.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the cool things that you can now do remotely without entering a password:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">scp file.svg axidraw.local:          <span style="color:#998;font-style:italic"># copy a local file to your remote user directory</span>
scp file.svg axidraw.local:files/    <span style="color:#998;font-style:italic"># copy a local file the remote ~/files/ directory</span>
scp axidraw.local:files/file.svg ./  <span style="color:#998;font-style:italic"># copy a remote file locally</span>

ssh axidraw.local     <span style="color:#998;font-style:italic"># log to your remote RPi</span>
ssh axidraw.local ls  <span style="color:#998;font-style:italic"># list the files in your home directory</span>

cat my_file.svg | ssh axidraw.local axicli -L <span style="color:#099">2</span> -d <span style="color:#099">37</span> -u <span style="color:#099">60</span> -N -m plot   <span style="color:#998;font-style:italic"># plot a file!</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This last one is particularly nice. SSH allows you to pipe the output of a local command (here <code>cat</code> just outputs the contents of <code>my_file.svg</code>) into a remote command&rsquo;s input. This is a very powerful combination that I use for this project.</p>
<h3 id="controlling-the-camera-and-the-feeder">Controlling the camera and the feeder</h3>
<p>The <code>campi.local</code> Raspberry Pi has two missions: taking a picture of the frame after it is drawn, and run the motor to feed blank paper for the next frame. One of the easiest ways to make these functionalities remote controllable is to run a small HTTP server with two end-points, one for each task.</p>
<p>This is <em>really</em> easy to do with <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com">FastAPI</a> (<a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/">Flask</a> would also work just as well). The corresponding code is available <a href="https://github.com/abey79/sketches/tree/master/world/campi">here</a>, along with a <code>requirements.txt</code> file listing the required packages.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>All it takes to run the server is to the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">uvicorn campi:app --host campi.local --port <span style="color:#099">8000</span>
</code></pre></div><p><a href="https://www.uvicorn.org">Uvicorn</a> is a web server implementation fo Python uses FastAPI (in our case) to handle web requests. Here, <code>campi:app</code> tells Uvicorn to use the <code>app</code> object in the <code>campi</code> module (assuming our file is named <code>campi.py</code>).</p>
<p>Note in passing how having ZeroConf setup with the RPi means that, once again, we don&rsquo;t need to mess with explicit IP addresses. (Here, specifying a <code>--host</code> other than the default <code>localhost</code> is required to allow another computer to access the server.)</p>
<p>With the server running, any other computer on the local network can acquire a photo using the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">curl -s -o /tmp/test.png campi.local:8000/img/?ev<span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=</span><span style="color:#099">1</span>
</code></pre></div><p>A couple of learnings from the field:</p>
<ul>
<li>Like in the example above, I&rsquo;m using an exposure value of +1 with the #plotloop machine. This is because the white paper tend to lead to underexposure. With the code above, this parameter doesn&rsquo;t seem to have effect until after the second picture is taken. So, after starting the server, I always use the command above to have one picture taken with <code>ev=1</code> so the camera is primed when the machine actually uses it.</li>
<li>The server can run for a long time, taking multiple hundreds of pictures (the rotating earth loop is 280-frame long). So it&rsquo;s pretty important that the <code>/img/</code> end-point doesn&rsquo;t leak any memory. Especially uncompressed-frame-sized buffers. I actually ran into this issue with the first implementation, which used a memory buffer instead of a temporary file. After messing with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tracemalloc.html"><code>tracemalloc</code></a> for a while to figure this out, it ended up being just easier to switch implementation. For my first loop with the machine, the leak would fill my RPi&rsquo;s memory and crash every 20 images or so&mdash;it was painful process to go through the whole loop!</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="paper-feed">Moving the motor</h4>
<p>I use another end-point to control the feeder motor. This time, it includes a mandatory parameter in the URL: the approximate number of centimetre of paper to feed. Here is how it looks in the code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#3c5d5d;font-weight:bold">@app</span><span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">.</span>get(<span style="color:#d14">&#34;/motor/</span><span style="color:#d14">{cm}</span><span style="color:#d14">&#34;</span>)
<span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#900;font-weight:bold">run_motor</span>(cm: <span style="color:#0086b3">int</span>):
	<span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">...</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Using this end-point is as easy as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">curl -s campi.local:8000/motor/5
</code></pre></div><p>The implementation is really boring. The gist of controlling a stepper motor is to toggle a GPIO up and down as many times as needed&mdash;one per step. This could easily be done manually, but I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://github.com/gavinlyonsrepo/RpiMotorLib">RpiMotorLib</a> to reduce the code to a single line. The conversion from centimetre to step count depends on your motor (mine has 400 steps per full rotation, which is fairly standard) and the feeder wheel size. I have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)">magic number</a> in the code that I tuned by trial-and-error.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that the accuracy of the feeder mechanisms is not critical for this machine because the paper isn&rsquo;t moved at all between the frame being drawn and the picture taken. The feeder has thus no impact on frame-to-frame alignment&mdash;only the plotter&rsquo;s repeatability matters here (which is a non-issue with the AxiDraw ❤️).</p>
<p>Another couple of things I learned on the way:</p>
<ul>
<li>As mentioned earlier, the motor and the driver can generate quite a bit of heat and power consumption when active, even when not moving. That&rsquo;s why I manually toggle the ENABLE pin in the <code>motor</code> end-point. That way the motor is kept unpowered most of the time, and only activated when it must be moved.</li>
<li>With the Raspberry Pi, it&rsquo;s important to properly shut down the GPIO sub-system when exiting your program. It avoids some errors and minimise the risk for the hardware<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. The proper way to do this with FastAPI is to implement a shutdown event handler:
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#3c5d5d;font-weight:bold">@app</span><span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">.</span>on_event(<span style="color:#d14">&#34;shutdown&#34;</span>)

</ul>
<h3 id="using-vsketch-for-plot-loops">Using <em>vsketch</em> for plot loops</h3>
<p>Unsurprisingly, I&rsquo;ve used <a href="https://github.com/abey79/vsketch"><em>vsketch</em></a> to generate the animation frames. Before diving into the actual sketch I made for this article, I want to shortly digress on how to structure a sketch to produce SVGs suitable for plot loops.</p>
<p>Here is a simple example of a plot loop sketch:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>This sketch (<a href="https://github.com/abey79/vsketch/tree/master/examples/basic_plotloop">available</a> in the <em>vsketch</em> <a href="https://github.com/abey79/vsketch">repository</a>) animates a small circle rotating around a larger circle<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>:</p>
<img src="/automatic-plotloop-machine/demo_plotloop.gif"width="200px"style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"/>
<p>The first noteworthy aspect is its use of the two parameters: <code>frame_count</code> and <code>frame</code>. This makes it super easy to control the animation length and generate all the frames. For example, the frames for this GIF were generated with the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">vsk save plotloop -m -p frame_count <span style="color:#099">13</span> -p frame 0..12
</code></pre></div><p>(Note the use of <code>-m</code> to use all available CPU cores.)</p>
<p>Another key element is to use <code>center=False</code> in the initial <code>vsk.size()</code> call. Without this, <em>vsketch</em> would auto-centre every frame based on the geometry and this would result in the animation wobbling around. I actually made a similar mistake with one of my first plot loop<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>:</p>
<img src="/automatic-plotloop-machine/columns_marie.gif"alt="plot loop of a pixelated 3d structure exhibiting wobbling due to inconsistent centring"width="200px"style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"/>
<p>Last but not least, notice how the algorithm generates the exact same frame for <code>frame = 0</code> and <code>frame = frame_count</code><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. This is obviously necessary to obtain a properly looping behaviour&mdash;but is easier said than done for all but trivial examples.</p>
<p>One way is to use periodic trigonometric functions such as sine and cosine like I did in the example above. This is also the approach I used for the rotating Earth loop.</p>
<p>Many generative artwork rely on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise">Perlin noise</a>. Some implementations <em>may</em> offer some kind of periodicity that could be used to generate a looping set of frames. Alternatively, periodicity can be achieved by sampling the noise field along cylindrical coordinates instead of on a cartesian grid.</p>
<img src="/automatic-plotloop-machine/rect_vs_cylindrical.png"alt="schema illustrating cartesian versus cylindrical sampling of a Perlin noise field"width="100%"style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"/>
<p>An entire article could be written on this topic, and this one is long enough. Instead, I&rsquo;ve added <a href="https://github.com/abey79/vsketch/tree/master/examples/noise_bezier">another example</a> to the <em>vsketch</em> repository to illustrate this principle:</p>

<h3 id="the-rotating-earth-sketch">The rotating Earth sketch</h3>
<p>The full sketch code is too long to be reproduced in this article&mdash;it&rsquo;s available <a href="https://github.com/abey79/sketches/blob/master/world/sketch_world.py">here</a> in my <a href="https://github.com/abey79/sketches/">sketches</a> repository on GitHub. Instead, I will provide here an overview of how it&rsquo;s implemented. You might want to open the code in another window to follow along.</p>
<h4 id="data-preprocessing">Data preprocessing</h4>
<p>First, the data. I used the <a href="https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/esri::world-countries-generalized/about">World Country</a> boundaries from <a href="https://www.esri.com">ESRI</a>. It contains polygons for all countries in the world. By merging them with <a href="https://shapely.readthedocs.io">Shapely</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html#shapely.ops.unary_union"><code>unary_union()</code></a>, one can obtain the land/water boundaries. This happens in the <code>build_world()</code> function.</p>
<p>Here is how the merged countries look after the union step:</p>
<img src="/automatic-plotloop-machine/world_latlon.png"width="100%"style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"/>
<p>There is one oddity I had to deal with, which explains the magic numbers and other ugliness in that function: Antarctica. This is the only body of land sitting <em>over</em> one of the poles, which are singularities in the latitude/longitude coordinate system.</p>
<img src="/automatic-plotloop-machine/antarctica.png"width="100%"style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"/>
<p>The left is how the data looked like originally. On the right is the boundary once the artificial limit at ~80°S is removed. In lat/long coordinates, it becomes a self-intersecting polygon. This can be dealt with a simple Shapely trick: create a <code>LinearRing</code> with the (self-intersecting) boundary and apply <code>unary_union()</code> on it. This creates a <code>MultiLineString</code> containing a corresponding list of non-intersecting linear rings.</p>
<p>This is the glitch that this procedure solved:</p>
<img src="/automatic-plotloop-machine/antarctica_glitch.png"width="40%"style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"/>
<p>Another important step is to filter land masses by area, to avoid the myriads of tiny isles that would clutter the result and massively increase plotting time. You can&rsquo;t just use the <code>.area</code> attribute from Shapely with lat/lon coordinates as this isn&rsquo;t an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-area_map">equal-area projection</a>, so I shamelessly copy/pasted <code>polygon_area()</code> from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/61177081/229511">StackOverflow</a>.</p>
<p>The final preprocessing step consist of converting the lat/lon land boundaries (stored in a Shapely <code>Polygon</code> instance) into 3D points on the unit sphere (stored as a Nx3 NumPy array). This is done by the <code>project_polygon()</code> function. The projected boundaries are stored in the <code>LINES</code> global variable.</p>
<h4 id="rendering-the-earth">Rendering the Earth</h4>
<p>The Earth rendering can be broken into the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rotate the Earth data as needed.</li>
<li>Crop away the &ldquo;far side&rdquo; part of the data.</li>
<li>Project orthogonally the rest of the data, a.k.a. drop the coordinate along which the backside was cropped and use the other two for drawing.</li>
<li>Draw a circle :)</li>
</ol>
<p>For rotation, I first compute 3 angles around the X, Y, and Z axes. These angles can be manually set for testing, or generated by trigonometric functions with different frequencies. Naturally, I make sure that these function are periodic with the frame count for a properly looping behaviour.</p>
<p>I then generate 3 rotation matrices:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Here, <code>.T</code> is used for transpose, and is needed for NumPy <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.broadcasting.html">broadcasting</a> rules to work. Remember that the actual calculation (3x3 matrix multiplication on every single points in <code>line</code>) happens in highly optimised C code, so this operation is <em>fast</em>.</p>
<p>Cropping is actually a bit trickier because you have to account for lines that may go from the front side to the far side and back, possibly multiple times. The cropping operation on a single line may thus result in multiple &ldquo;sub-lines&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Luckily, I had already sorted out most this for <em>vpype</em>&rsquo;s <code>crop</code> command. <em>vpype</em>&rsquo;s API includes the <code>crop_half_plane()</code> function, which crops a line at a give location along one of the X or Y axis<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. Adapting it to the 3rd dimension was trivial. While copy/pasting the function, I took along <code>_interpolate_crop()</code>, which deals specifically with computing the intersection of a line segment with the cropping plane.</p>
<p>Once the land boundary lines are cropped along one dimension, it&rsquo;s a matter of drawing them using the other two dimensions using <code>vsk.polygons</code>. Which dimension is used for what is not very important since we&rsquo;re dealing with a sphere. I made it so that when rotation angles are set to 0, the (0°, 0°) lat/lon point (somewhere in the Atlantic ocean, off Ghana) is dead in the center of the rendered Earth.</p>
<p>In the sketch code, you&rsquo;ll also find controls to enable pixelation using <a href="https://github.com/abey79/vpype-pixelart"><em>vpype-pixelart</em></a>. I ran some trials with it but decided against it&mdash;to messy for this kind of line work.</p>

<h3 id="putting-it-all-together-with-doit">Putting it all together with <em>doit</em></h3>
<p>At this point, all the #plotloop machine&rsquo;s body parts are in place and just need a beating heart to set them in motion. <a href="https://pydoit.org"><em>doit</em></a> is the perfect tool for this.</p>
<p>Although <em>doit</em> is rather easy to use, it still has a tiny bit of a learning curve. If this is your first ever encounter with it, you might want to check the <a href="/articles/2022/11/10/batch-processing-doit-vpype/">introductory article</a> I recently wrote. This project takes this to a whole new level.</p>
<p>Instead of looking at the <a href="https://github.com/abey79/sketches/blob/master/world/dodo.py"><code>dodo.py</code></a> file line by line, I&rsquo;ll first provide an overview of the workflows it implements (again, you might want to open the file in another window to follow along). Then, I&rsquo;ll go deeper into a few, hand-picked topics to highlight interesting techniques.</p>
<h4 id="the-workflows">The workflows</h4>
<p>The bulk of the <code>dodo.py</code> file implements two workflows using a bunch of tasks: one is to create a simulated animation based on the frames' SVG, and another to plot, photograph, post-process, and assemble the frames into the final animation.</p>
<p>Here is a schematic of the workflows.</p>
<img src="/automatic-plotloop-machine/workflows.svg"alt="box schematic illustrating the workflows implemented to run the plotloop machine"width="100%"style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"/>
<p>Let&rsquo;s review the tasks involved in creating the simulated animation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>generate</code> task generates all the frame SVGs with a single call to <em>vsketch</em>. It is basically running some version of this command:
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">vsk save . -m -p frame_count <span style="color:#099">280</span> -p frame 1..280
</code></pre></div>The outcome of this task is one SVG file per frame, numbered from 1 to 280.</li>
<li>Each of the <code>simframe:XXXX</code> sub-task takes one frame SVG and convert it to a JPG with a <code>_simulated</code> prefix using <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg">librsvg</a>&rsquo;s <code>rsvg-convert</code><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. The sub-tasks are named after their corresponding frame number, e.g. <code>simframe:0010</code> correspond to the frame number 10.</li>
<li>Finally, the <code>simulate</code> task combines all the simulated frames into a single animated GIF, using <a href="https://imagemagick.org">ImageMagick</a>&rsquo;s <code>convert</code> command.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m calling this a workflow because each of these tasks have their <code>file_dep</code> and <code>targets</code> carefully defined. As a result, <em>doit</em> understands the dependency relationship between them. From a clean slate, calling <code>doit simulate</code> will first execute <code>generate</code>, then each of the <code>simframe:XXXX</code> sub-tasks, before finally running <code>simulate</code> to produce the animation.</p>
<p>The workflow for the actually plotted animation is similarly structured, but includes an additional post-processing step:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The workflow starts with the same <code>generate</code> task as before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each of the frame is then plotted and photographed by the corresponding <code>plot:XXXX</code> sub-task, which performs the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plot the frame by sending the SVG via SSH to <code>axicli</code> running on the <code>axidraw.local</code> RPi (as  described <a href="#ssh-rpi">earlier</a>).</li>
<li>Move the pen away by 3 inches to get it out of camera view (again, using SSH and <code>axicli</code>).</li>
<li>Take a picture of the frame and download the corresponding image using <code>curl</code> (as described <a href="#taking-pictures">earlier</a>).</li>
<li>Move the pen back to its original position.</li>
<li>Feed fresh paper using <code>curl</code> (as described <a href="#paper-feed">earlier</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a good example of how a single <em>doit</em> task may execute multiple CLI commands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each frame is then post-processed by the corresponding <code>postprocess:XXXX</code> sub-task using <code>convert</code>. It rotates the image in the correct orientation, crops it tightly around the earth, converts it to grayscale, and bumps its brightness and contrast a bit. This is the command used:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">convert frame_XXXX_plotted.jpg -rotate <span style="color:#099">270</span> -crop 1900x1900+605+785 <span style="color:#d14">\
</span><span style="color:#d14"></span>  -colorspace Gray -brightness-contrast 5x15 frame_XXXX_postprocessed.jpg
</code></pre></div></li>
<li>
<p>Finally, the <code>animation</code> task combines all post-processed frames into the final animated GIF using <code>convert</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One may wonder, why is the <code>postprocess:XXXX</code> task separate from the <code>plot:XXXX</code> task? The <code>convert</code> command could just as well be added to the list of commands <code>plot:XXXX</code> executes. The answer is to be able to tweak the post-processing step without invalidating the plotting process. If both tasks were merged, any modification to the post-processing (e.g. adjusting the cropping parameters) would require re-plotting the entire frame&mdash;a lengthy process! This issue disappears with a stand-alone <code>postprocess:XXXX</code> task, which is very powerful when fine-tuning the workflow.</p>
<h4 id="basic-doit-syntax">Basic <em>doit</em> syntax</h4>
<p>Armed with this <code>dodo.py</code> file, we are now in complete control of our workflow.</p>
<p>Here are a few example commands (I won&rsquo;t list all the output here, check my <a href="/articles/2022/11/10/batch-processing-doit-vpype/">other article</a> for a gentler introduction on how it behaves).</p>
<p>First, <em>doit</em> always provides a list of available tasks with <code>doit list</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">animation     Make the animation.
disable_xy    Disable X/Y motors
generate      Generates golden master SVGs from the list of input files.
plot          Plot the plotter-ready SVGs.
postprocess   Post-process the plotted images.
shutdown      Shutdown everything
simframe      Simulate a frame.
simulate      Make the simulated animation.
toggle        Toggle pen up/down
</code></pre></div><p>Generating the frame SVGs is a matter of:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">doit generate
</code></pre></div><p>This is not needed though, as this task is automatically run when executing other tasks depending on it. For example, this executes <code>generate</code> (if needed) and all the <code>simframe:XXXX</code> sub-tasks to produce the simulated GIF:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">doit simulate
</code></pre></div><p>A single simulated frame can be generated by specifying the frame number:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">doit simframe:0118
</code></pre></div><p>This works because I chose to name sub-tasks after the corresponding (zero-padded) frame number.</p>
<p>All the frames can be generated at once by omitting the sub-task name:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">doit simframe
</code></pre></div><p>Likewise, producing the final, plotted animation is just a matter of running the following command and waiting 9 hours 🕰:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">doit animation
</code></pre></div><h4 id="executing-a-range-of-sub-tasks">Executing a range of sub-tasks</h4>
<p>It is often useful to execute a range of sub-tasks. For example, early testing requires plotting, say, the first 10 frames to verify that everything works correctly. (Spoiler alert: it doesn&rsquo;t! The process must be repeated several times until all the glitches are worked out.)</p>
<p>Thankfully, this is made very easy thanks to bash&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Brace-Expansion.html">brace expansion</a> syntax (it works the same with zsh and, probably, other shells<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>).</p>
<p>Here is an illustration to demonstrate the idea:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#0086b3">echo</span> <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">{</span>1..5<span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The braces with the <code>..</code> syntax are interpreted by bash as a range that needs expansion. Accordingly, the output of the above is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="color:#099">1</span> <span style="color:#099">2</span> <span style="color:#099">3</span> <span style="color:#099">4</span> <span style="color:#099">5</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The good news is that it understands zero-padding:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#0086b3">echo</span> <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">{</span>0001..0015<span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This produces:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="color:#099">0001</span> <span style="color:#099">0002</span> <span style="color:#099">0003</span> <span style="color:#099">0004</span> <span style="color:#099">0005</span> <span style="color:#099">0006</span> <span style="color:#099">0007</span> <span style="color:#099">0008</span> <span style="color:#099">0009</span> <span style="color:#099">0010</span> <span style="color:#099">0011</span> <span style="color:#099">0012</span> <span style="color:#099">0013</span> <span style="color:#099">0014</span> <span style="color:#099">0015</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Knowing this, we can instruct <em>doit</em> to plot a specific frame range with the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">doit plot:<span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">{</span>0005..0015<span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This expends to <code>doit plot:0005 plot:0006 plot:0007 ...</code>, which <em>doit</em> interprets as a list of tasks to be executed.</p>
<p>This syntax is beautifully consistent with both the single task form (<code>doit plot:0012</code>) and <em>vsketch</em>&rsquo;s <code>-p,--param</code> option (<code>vsk save -p frame 1..280</code>). It&rsquo;s also yet another shining example of how powerful terminals can be for automation.</p>
<p>Note that, again, this is enabled by my choice of consistently naming sub-tasks after their zero-padded frame number.</p>
<h4 id="path-management">Path management</h4>
<p>This <code>dodo.py</code> file wrangles with a lot of different files. Each frame has up to 4 corresponding files (the original SVG, the simulated JPG, the plotted JPG, and the post-processed JPG), each with a specific suffix.</p>
<p>A small helper class is useful to manage this complexity. Here is how it looks:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">import</span> <span style="color:#555">pathlib</span>

</code></pre></div><p><code>FileSpec</code> instances are created based on a frame number, and contain all the paths related to the corresponding frame. This is easy to implement using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html"><code>pathlib</code></a> module from the standard library.</p>
<p>Note that <em>vsketch</em> doesn&rsquo;t zero-pad the frame number in the SVGs it produces. This is a bit unfortunate as it messes up alphabetical ordering for most CLI tools (for example, this creates frame ordering issues when creating a GIF from a bunch of JPGs). All the other paths are constructed with zero-padding.</p>
<p>Also notice the <code>PIXELIZE</code> global variable. Its value is forwarded as a parameter to <em>vsketch</em>, which controls whether <em>vpype-pixelize</em> should be used. As noted above, I&rsquo;ve decided against it for this project. In any case, I made sure to reflect this value in all the files' base name to avoid confusion by <em>doit</em> when changing the parameter&rsquo;s value.</p>
<p>The <code>FILE_SPECS</code> global variable contains a dictionary which maps the <code>FileSpec</code> instance to the corresponding frame number. This simplifies a lot the task implementation.</p>
<h4 id="task-dependencies">Task dependencies</h4>
<p>As I explained in my <a href="/articles/2022/11/10/batch-processing-doit-vpype/">previous article</a>, proper handling of task targets and dependencies is key for <em>doit</em> to understand the structure of the workflows and be smart about which task must be executed when.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider the <code>simframe:XXXX</code> sub-tasks as an example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#900;font-weight:bold">task_simframe</span>():

            ],
            <span style="color:#d14">&#34;file_dep&#34;</span>: [spec<span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">.</span>source],

        }
</code></pre></div><p>Each sub-task has the source SVG file set as <code>file_dep</code>, and the simulated JPG file as <code>targets</code>. Since this stage of the workflow is structured as sub-tasks&mdash;one sub-task per frame&mdash;each sub-task focuses on a single input and output file.</p>
<p>In contrast, the <code>simulate</code> task needs <em>all</em> the simulated frames to create a single animated GIF:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#900;font-weight:bold">task_simulate</span>():

    }
</code></pre></div><p>In this case, <code>file_dep</code> contains all the simulated frames, while <code>targets</code> has the animated GIF.</p>
<p>These snippets also illustrate how the <code>FileSpec</code> class and the <code>FILE_SPECS</code> global variable simplify the task implementation.</p>
<h4 id="depending-on-dodopy">Depending on <code>dodo.py</code></h4>
<p>Adding the <code>dodo.py</code> file to the dependency list might sound like a smart idea. Indeed, a modification of the <code>dodo.py</code> may potentially invalidate all generated files.</p>
<p>In our case, this can be done in the <code>generate</code> task, on which all other tasks depend:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#900;font-weight:bold">task_generate</span>():

</code></pre></div><p>The path of the <code>dodo.py</code> file is conveniently stored in the <code>__file__</code> global variable by the Python interpreter, so it is a matter of adding it to the <code>file_dep</code>.</p>
<p>(Notice, in passing, that the sketch file is also listed as <code>file_dep</code>. This triggers a complete rebuild whenever the sketch file is modified.)</p>
<p>This technique is useful in the beginning to ensure that intermediate files potentially contaminated by bugs of an early, in-construction <code>dodo.py</code> file are properly rebuilt when the bug is fixed. It can, however, become an annoyance later on. Executing all of the <code>plot:XXXX</code> sub-tasks takes about 9 hours in total. You really don&rsquo;t want to repeat the whole thing just because of a code formatting fix or added comment in <code>dodo.py</code>! As such, the <code>dodo.py</code> is <em>not</em> listed as dependency in the file on GitHub.</p>
<h4 id="helper-tasks">Helper tasks</h4>
<p>In addition to the main workflows described so far, the <code>dodo.py</code> file includes a few helper tasks to toggle the pen up/down, disable the motor power (which is always better when the keeping the AxiDraw powered but unused for long periods of time), and shutdown everything (the RPis and the AxiDraw).</p>
<p>The code is really straightforward, but very handy to have around. It&rsquo;s basically a thin wrapper over <code>axicli</code> functionalities:</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://pydoit.org"><em>doit</em></a> (a.k.a. PyDoIt) is a fantastic Python-based tool to automate repetitive workflows. It works particularly well alongside <a href="https://vpype.readthedocs.io"><em>vpype</em></a> to address mundane plotting-related tasks. This article explains in details how to automate an SVG optimisation and conversion workflow.</p>
<p>Most plotter workflows involve one or more repetitive steps which, when executed manually, take time, are boring, and possibly error-prone. Here are some examples that come to mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimizing SVGs using <em>vpype</em>&rsquo;s <code>linemerge reloop linesort linesimplify</code> commands.</li>
<li>Converting SVGs into a format your plotter understands (e.g. HPGL, or G-code using <a href="https://github.com/plottertools/vpype-gcode">vpype-gcode</a>).</li>
<li>Splitting multi-layer SVGs into individual layers (e.g. if this is a requirement of your plotter for multi-colour plots).</li>
<li>Making a PNG version of SVGs for archival purposes.</li>
<li>Running the <code>axicli</code> command to plot an SVG with an <a href="https://axidraw.com">Axidraw</a>.</li>
<li>Uploading optimised files to the computer/server/Raspberry Pi in control of your plotter.</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only your workflow may include one or more of these steps, but you may need to apply it on a single SVG at a time, or on a bunch of them at once. Even better, you might want to apply your workflow only on SVGs which were updated or created since the last execution.</p>
<p>You can do exactly that with <em>doit</em>&mdash;let&rsquo;s see how.</p>
<h2 id="installing-doit">Installing <em>doit</em></h2>
<p>Although <a href="https://pydoit.org/install.html">its documentation</a> sadly doesn&rsquo;t mention it, <a href="https://pypa.github.io/pipx/">pipx</a> is the best way to install <em>doit</em> (as for <a href="https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html"><em>vpype</em></a>):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">$ pipx install doit
</code></pre></div><p>You can check that the installation was successful by running this command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">$ doit --version
0.36.0
lib @ /Users/&lt;username&gt;/.local/pipx/venvs/doit/lib/python3.10/site-packages/doit
</code></pre></div><h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>
<p>As a starting point, let&rsquo;s assume you have a bunch of SVGs which need optimising before plotting, stored in a <code>originals</code> subdirectory. Save the optimisation commands in a <a href="https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fundamentals.html#command-files">VPY file</a> named <code>optimize.vpy</code>, with the following content:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-perl" data-lang="perl">linemerge reloop linesort linesimplify
</code></pre></div><p>Then, create a subdirectory named <code>processed</code>, which will contain the optimised SVGs:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">$ mkdir processed 
</code></pre></div><p>Here is how your file hierarchy should look like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>.
├── optimize.vpy
├── originals/
│   ├── dots.svg
│   ├── halftone.svg
│   └── hline.svg
└── processed/
</code></pre><p>Our goal is to have <em>doit</em> automate the optimisation of the source SVGs in <code>originals</code>, and store the result in <code>processed</code>.</p>
<p><em>doit</em> operates by loading a description of the task(s) it must execute, typically in a file named <code>dodo.py</code><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. As the name suggests, the content of this file is Python code.</p>

            ],
        }
</code></pre></div><p>Let&rsquo;s examine this code line-by-line.</p>
<ol>
<li>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html"><code>pathlib</code></a> built-in module is great at file wrangling. Check <a href="https://realpython.com/python-pathlib/">this Real Python article</a> for a gentle yet thorough introduction.</li>
<li>Here we use it to find our project directory, which is the parent of the present file, whose path is stored in the <code>__file__</code> variable by the Python interpreter.</li>
<li>We list all the SVGs contained in the <code>originals</code> subdirectory, and store them in the <code>SOURCES</code> variable. Note that <code>glob()</code> returns a generator, which must be converted to a <code>list</code> if <code>SOURCES</code> is to be iterated multiple times.</li>
<li>We keep the path to the <code>optimize.vpy</code> file in the <code>VPY</code> variable.</li>
<li>Python functions with name starting with <code>task_</code> are interpreted by <em>doit</em> as <a href="https://pydoit.org/tasks.html">tasks</a>. Here we have just one. Let&rsquo;s call it &ldquo;optimize&rdquo;, thus the <code>task_optimize()</code> function name.</li>
<li>The function&rsquo;s <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/">docstring</a> is used by <em>doit</em> as help string for the task, so it is useful to include one.</li>
<li>Task functions must return one or more Python dictionaries describing the task. In our case, we want to create one <a href="https://pydoit.org/tasks.html#sub-tasks">sub-tasks</a> per source SVG file.</li>
<li>For each source SVG, we derive the path for the corresponding optimised SVG. The optimised SVG are located in the <code>processed</code> subdirectory and have a <code>_optimized.svg</code> suffix to their name.</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#yieldexpr"><code>yield</code></a> keyword (instead of <code>return</code>) makes our function a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-generator">generator</a> (gentle introduction available <a href="https://realpython.com/introduction-to-python-generators/">here</a>). This is a convenient way to return (er&hellip; yield) multiple objects, which is supported by <em>doit</em>. Here, we yield one dictionary per sub-task.</li>
<li>Sub-tasks must be individually named so that they can be distinguished. Here we derive the sub-task name from the source SVG filename. For example, the sub-task corresponding to <code>my_file.svg</code> will be named <code>my_file</code>, and can be referred to with <em>doit</em> as <code>optimize:my_file</code>.</li>
<li>Last but not least, the <code>&quot;actions&quot;</code> entry of the sub-task dictionary lists the actions to be performed by the task. <em>doit</em> interprets strings as shell commands, so we build a <em>vpype</em> pipeline to optimise the source SVG using our VPY and saving the result in the desired location. For example, for <code>my_file.svg</code>, the action will be <code>vpype read originals/my_file.svg -I optimize.vpy write processed/my_file_optimized.svg</code><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a step back to properly understand what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>The function <code>task_optimize()</code> produces a task <em>description</em>&mdash;it does not actually <em>run</em> the task. When we run <em>doit</em> (using the <code>doit</code> command), it loads the <code>dodo.py</code> file, notices that it contains a task function, and calls it to learn about that task. It&rsquo;s only <em>then</em> that it can decide which action(s) to actually execute, based on the task description. In this case, the actions are the <em>vpype</em> pipelines stored in the <code>&quot;actions&quot;</code> entries.</p>
<p>Although this <code>dodo.py</code> file is not overly complicated, it can still feel like quite some work compared to, you know, just calling <em>vpype</em> manually. I certainly felt so when first using <em>doit</em>. So let&rsquo;s see what we gained by going through this effort.</p>
<p>First and foremost, we now have a potent batch processing system. We can optimise all of our source SVGs by telling <em>doit</em> to execute the <code>optimize</code> task:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">$ doit optimize
.  optimize:dots
.  optimize:halftone
.  optimize:hline
</code></pre></div><p>Here is the result after running this command:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>.
├── dodo.py
├── optimize.vpy
├── originals/
│   ├── dots.svg
│   ├── halftone.svg
│   └── hline.svg
└── processed/
    ├── dots_optimized.svg
    ├── halftone_optimized.svg
    └── hline_optimized.svg
</code></pre><p><em>doit</em> indeed created properly-named, optimised versions of the source SVGs in the <code>processed</code> directory! 🎉</p>
<p>Since we only have just one task defined, we don&rsquo;t even need to specify its name:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">$ doit
.  optimize:dots
.  optimize:halftone
.  optimize:hline
</code></pre></div><p>You can also specify a specific sub-task to execute:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">$ doit optimize:halftone
.  optimize:halftone
</code></pre></div><p>Pretty neat already&mdash;but there is a lot more to gain with a little more effort!</p>
<h2 id="handling-targets-and-dependencies">Handling targets and dependencies</h2>
<p>Playing with the commands above, you may notice that each call of the <code>optimize</code> task triggers the processing of the corresponding SVGs&mdash;even if said SVGs were already processed before. The reason for this is that <em>doit</em> doesn&rsquo;t yet know what the task inputs and outputs are, so it cannot check whether that output exists or is outdated. So, to be on the safe side, it <em>always</em> executes <em>all specified tasks</em> every time.</p>
<p>By letting <em>doit</em> know about tasks' inputs and outputs, <em>doit</em> can be much smarter about what it actually needs to do.</p>
<p>In <em>doit</em> parlance, the file(s) a task uses as input are called <em>dependencies</em> (<code>&quot;file_dep&quot;</code> entry). Likewise, the file(s) created as output are called <em>targets</em> (<code>&quot;targets&quot;</code> entry). By specifying what these are in the <code>dodo.py</code> file, <em>doit</em> can decide whether the target of a given task needs to be generated or not, saving a lot of time when repeating the workflow.</p>
<p>Update the <code>dodo.py</code> file as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">import</span> <span style="color:#555">pathlib</span>

<li>The <code>&quot;targets&quot;</code> entry is a list of all the files generated by the sub-task. In our case, there is only one, whose path is stored in the <code>optimized</code> variable.</li>
<li>The <code>&quot;file_dep&quot;</code> entry is a list of all the files the sub-task depends on. In our case, both the source SVG and the VPY file are involved to create an optimised SVG, so we list them both.</li>
</ol>
<p>It would be easy to forget the VPY file in the <code>&quot;file_dep&quot;</code> entry. That would be a mistake. All the optimised SVGs should be regenerated when the VPY file is modified. For <em>doit</em> to realise this, we must list the VPY file as a dependency.</p>
<p>With the modification above, <em>doit</em> now knows when to run optimisation sub-tasks and when they can be skipped.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s experiment with a clean slate by deleting all the processed files:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">$ rm processed/*.svg
</code></pre></div><p><em>doit</em> must now execute all sub-tasks:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">$ doit
.  optimize:dots
.  optimize:halftone
.  optimize:hline
</code></pre></div><p>Notice the dot (<code>.</code>) prefixing each line and how the execution is relatively slow.</p>
<p>Now, this is what happens if we run <em>doit</em> again:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">$ doit
-- optimize:dots
-- optimize:halftone
-- optimize:hline
</code></pre></div><p>Execution time is now much faster and each line is now prefixed with <code>--</code>, indicating that <em>doit</em> skipped the corresponding sub-task.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see what happens if one of the source file is modified.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">$ <span style="color:#0086b3">echo</span> <span style="color:#d14">&#34; &#34;</span> &gt;&gt; originals/halftone.svg
$ doit
-- optimize:dots
.  optimize:halftone
-- optimize:hline
</code></pre></div><p>We first append a single space to the <code>halftone.svg</code> (which is harmless on a valid SVG) to simulate a change<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. As expected, <em>doit</em> rebuilds the of <code>halftone.svg</code> without running the other tasks! 🎉</p>
<p>We now have a setup able to automatically process large batches of files and be smart about if/when any sub-task must be repeated. You have a thousand SVGs to process? It&rsquo;s coffee time while the CPUs churn through them<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. You add just one to the list? Instant results, thanks to <em>doit</em>!</p>
<h2 id="cleaning-up">Cleaning up</h2>
<p>The files created by the <code>optimize</code> task can be considered &ldquo;temporary&rdquo;. When missing, they are automatically recreated by <em>doit</em>, and are overwritten by a new version when the input file (or the VPY file) change. In that sense, they matter much less than the source SVGs and the <code>dodo.py</code> file, which collectively form the &ldquo;recipe&rdquo; to build the optimised SVGs<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The ability to delete these files may occasionally be useful. For example, to force a complete rebuild of the optimised files, to make an archive with only the true source files, or simply to free some disk space.</p>
<p><em>doit</em> provides this feature with a single modification to the <code>dodo.py</code> file:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Works as expected! 🎉</p>
<h2 id="multiple-tasks">Multiple tasks</h2>
<p>Although <em>doit</em> already shines dealing with a single task, it reveals its true power when multiple tasks are involved&mdash;even more so when they depend on each other.</p>
<p>For the illustration purposes, let&rsquo;s imagine that we need to convert the optimised SVGs to HPGL, so that we may plot them on a shiny &lsquo;83 <a href="http://www.hpmuseum.net/display_item.php?hw=74">HP 7475a</a>. We&rsquo;ll add a second task for this<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s start by creating a new <code>hpgl</code> subdirectory to store the HPGL files:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">$ mkdir hpgl
</code></pre></div><p>Since we cleaned the optimised SVGs in the previous steps, this how your project directory should look:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>.
├── dodo.py
├── hpgl/
├── optimize.vpy
├── originals/
│   ├── dots.svg
│   ├── halftone.svg

└── processed/
</code></pre><p>Now, update the <code>dodo.py</code> file with the following content:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Let&rsquo;s examine the changes one-by-one.</p>
<ol>
<li>To clean things up and avoid code duplication, we factored in <code>optimized_path()</code> the code to derive the path of an optimised SVG from a source SVG.</li>
<li>We do the same to derive the path of an HPGL output from a source SVG in the <code>hpgl_path()</code> function. Note that neither of these function names start with <code>task_</code>, so they aren&rsquo;t interpreted as tasks by <em>doit</em>.</li>
<li>The only change to the <code>optimize</code> task is to use the <code>optimized_path()</code> helper function.</li>
<li>This part is interesting. The purpose of the <code>hpgl</code> task is to convert optimised SVG into HPGL files, yet we iterate over the <em>source</em> SVGs instead. The reason is, for our purposes, <code>SOURCES</code> is our master &ldquo;TODO list&rdquo;. Everything the <code>hpgl</code> task must do is indirectly due to the presence of source SVGs.</li>
<li>The source path is used <em>only</em> to derive the paths for the optimised SVG as well as the HPGL output. In particular, notice how <code>source</code> is not used anywhere in the return dictionaries.</li>
<li>The optimised SVGs is now a dependency (as opposed to a target in the <code>optimize</code> task).</li>
<li>Instead, the target is the HPGL file.</li>
</ol>
<p>These two tasks collectively form a &ldquo;pipeline&rdquo;. The output (or <em>target</em>) of the first task corresponds to the input (or <em>dependency</em>) of the second. <em>doit</em> understands that thanks to the <code>&quot;file_dep&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;targets&quot;</code> entries being properly populated&mdash;and can now be smart about it!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take it for a spin by executing the <code>hpgl</code> task:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">$ doit hpgl
.  optimize:dots
.  optimize:halftone
.  optimize:hline
.  hpgl:dots
.  hpgl:halftone
.  hpgl:hline
</code></pre></div><p><em>doit</em> knows that it needs optimised SVGs to create HPGL file, so it automatically executes the <code>optimize</code> task.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s remove a single HPGL file to test what happens. This can be done using the <code>doit clean</code> command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">$ doit clean hpgl:hline
hpgl:hline - removing file <span style="color:#d14">&#39;.../hpgl/hline.hpgl&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This is what happens when we run the <code>hpgl</code> task again:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">$ doit hpgl
-- optimize:dots
-- optimize:halftone
-- optimize:hline
-- hpgl:dots
-- hpgl:halftone
.  hpgl:hline
</code></pre></div><p>The optimised version of <code>hline.svg</code> is still present and up-to-date, so the corresponding task is skipped. Only the HPGL conversion is executed.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s change one of the source files, like we did earlier:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">$ <span style="color:#0086b3">echo</span> <span style="color:#d14">&#34; &#34;</span> &gt;&gt; originals/dots.svg  
$ doit hpgl
.  optimize:dots
-- optimize:halftone
-- optimize:hline
.  hpgl:dots
-- hpgl:halftone
-- hpgl:hline
</code></pre></div><p><em>doit</em> correctly runs both the <code>optimize</code> and <code>hpgl</code> sub-tasks for the corresponding file! 🎉</p>
<h2 id="helper-tasks">Helper tasks</h2>
<p>Tasks don&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to be part of an intricate pipeline with carefully specified targets and dependencies. They can also be just a nice little helper that encapsulate a useful shell command.</p>
<p>Consider for example this task, which can readily be added to our <code>dodo.py</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#900;font-weight:bold">task_show</span>():

        }
</code></pre></div><p>Its action consist of loading the source SVG and displaying it with <em>vpype</em>. This isn&rsquo;t necessarily part of your workflow, but is convenient to have handy:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">$ doit show:dots
</code></pre></div><p>The corresponding SVG is displayed by the <em>vpype</em> viewer:</p>
<img src="/batch-processing-doit-vpype/dots.png"alt="*vpype* viewer display a SVGs containing many dots arranged in a circle"width="80%"style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"/>
<p>This example is taken from <a href="https://github.com/abey79/vpype-perspective"><em>vpype-perspective</em></a>, where all the README&rsquo;s figures are made from VPYs files stored in the repository&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/abey79/vpype-perspective/tree/main/examples/figures"><code>examples/figures</code></a> subdirectory. The conversion of these VPYs into SVGs is handled by <em>doit</em> using this <a href="https://github.com/abey79/vpype-perspective/blob/main/examples/dodo.py"><code>dodo.py</code></a> file. It&rsquo;s a nice example of what can be done with <em>doit</em>.</p>
<h2 id="final-words">Final words</h2>
<p>If you made it that far, I hope you are convinced of how useful <em>doit</em> is for workflow automation.</p>
<p>In this article, I focused on <em>vpype</em>, but <em>doit</em> can be used for entirely different things. As a matter of fact, I used it to automate my <a href="https://twitter.com/abey79/status/1528735353741484033">#plotloop machine</a>, which I&rsquo;ve described in my <a href="/articles/2022/12/22/automatic-plotloop-machine/">next article</a>.</p>

<p>One of <em>doit</em> drawbacks is the fact that its <code>dodo.py</code> file is written in Python. Creating one requires at least <em>some</em> Python basics&mdash;or willingness to acquire them. This might put off people uninterested by code.</p>
<p>But this is also its greatest strength. You wield the full power of Python when writing your <code>dodo.py</code> file, without any of the constraints of configuration languages such as <a href="https://yaml.org">YAML</a> or <a href="https://toml.io/en/">TOML</a>. This extends the possibilities <em>much</em> further than what was covered here, and makes learning <em>doit</em> a great investment! 🎯</p>
<p>Ready to take the plunge? I&rsquo;m happy to help&mdash;just share details of your workflow in the comments 👇, on <a href="https://twitter.com/abey79">Twitter</a>/<a href="https://mastodon.social/@abey79">Mastodon</a>, or on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/XHP3dBg">Drawingbots Discord</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Edit</strong>: TIL what &ldquo;dolt&rdquo; (lowercase L) means 😅, and changed DoIt (uppercase i) into <em>doit</em>, consistently with their documentation.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Edit</strong>: Added a link to the Automatic #plotloop Machine article and updated the video.</em></p>

<p>The file may also have a different name, or be located elsewhere, but then its path should be provided to <code>doit</code>. Using <code>dodo.py</code> is simpler because this file is automatically detected and loaded by <em>doit</em>.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>The code actually generates full paths.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
<p>If you are used to <code>make</code> and similar systems, you might be tempted to <code>touch originals/halftone.svg</code> to trigger a rebuild instead of modifying the file&rsquo;s content. This doesn&rsquo;t work with <em>doit</em> as it uses a local database and file hashes instead of modification date to track dependencies.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:4" role="doc-endnote">
<p>By the way, you can parallelise the processing of large batches using <code>doit -n 8 optimize</code>, where <code>8</code> is the number of CPU cores to use.&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:5" role="doc-endnote">
<p>This bears strong similarities with software build systems, where compiled object files are created from source code by the compiler. As a matter of fact, <em>doit</em> can serve as a build system.&#160;<a href="#fnref:5" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:6" role="doc-endnote">
<p>This example is slightly over-engineered. <em>vpype</em> can optimise and export to HPGL in one command, so technically a single <em>doit</em> task is needed. Even if multiple commands were required (<em>vpype</em> or otherwise), they can all be listed in a single <em>doit</em> task&mdash;the <code>&quot;actions&quot;</code> entry is a list which can contain multiple items. It is still a relevant illustration for the many instances were multiple <em>doit</em> tasks are indeed useful.&#160;<a href="#fnref:6" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

      <title>TIL: use Plausible.io with a Sphinx documentation hosted on RTD</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although Google Analytics is very easy to setup on a <a href="https://readthedocs.org"><em>Read the Docs</em></a>-based documentation website, it requires a cookie banner to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a>-compliant and is otherwise questionable from a privacy-preservation point-of-view. As a result, I much prefer to use and support the excellent EU-based <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible.io</a> for traffic metrics instead.</p>
<p>This article explains how to setup a <em>Read the Docs</em>-based documentation with Plausible.io such that metrics are enabled only on &ldquo;production&rdquo; builds — e.g. the &ldquo;latest&rdquo; builds from the main branch and the version-tagged builds. This minimises the contamination of traffic statistics by development-related activities.</p>
<p>To achieve this, the basic idea is to customise your Sphinx template such that the <a href="https://plausible.io/docs/plausible-script">Plausible.io script</a> is only included when a <code>conf.py</code>-defined flag is set to <code>True</code>. This flag is then set based on <a href="https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/environment-variables.html">environment variables provided by <em>Read the Docs</em></a>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s dive in the details a step at a time.</p>
<h2 id="enabling-templates">Enabling templates</h2>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t done so already (for example to <a href="https://bylr.info/articles/2022/05/10/api-doc-with-sphinx-autoapi/">customise your API documentation</a>), create a <code>_templates</code> sub-directory and let Sphinx know that this is where custom templates are to be found:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#998;font-style:italic"># conf.py</span>

templates_path <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=</span> [<span style="color:#d14">&#34;_templates&#34;</span>]
</code></pre></div><h2 id="customising-the-template">Customising the template</h2>
<p>Then, a custom template can be created to include the Plausible.io script. Create a <code>_templates/base.html</code> file with the following content:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="color:#998;font-style:italic">&lt;!-- _templates/base.html --&gt;</span>
{% extends &#34;!base.html&#34; %}
{% block extrahead %}
    {% if enable_plausible %}
        &lt;<span style="color:#000080">script</span> <span style="color:#008080">defer</span> <span style="color:#008080">data-domain</span><span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=</span><span style="color:#d14">&#34;myproject.readthedocs.io&#34;</span>
                <span style="color:#008080">src</span><span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=</span><span style="color:#d14">&#34;https://plausible.io/js/script.js&#34;</span>&gt;&lt;/<span style="color:#000080">script</span>&gt;
    {% endif %}
    {{ super() }}
{% endblock %}
</code></pre></div><p>In <code>_templates/base.html</code>, replace <code>myproject.readthedocs.io</code> by the actual domain name of your documentation. This domain name must also be enabled in your Plausible.io account.</p>
<p>Note that the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag is added <em>only</em> if the template variable <code>enable_plausible</code> evaluates to <code>True</code>. This is how we can control whether or not metrics should be enabled for a given build.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: I&rsquo;m using the <a href="https://pradyunsg.me/furo/quickstart/">Furo</a> theme, which uses <code>base.html</code> as main HTML file. Other themes (including the default Sphinx theme) might be using <code>layout.html</code> instead, as indicated in <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/templating.html">Sphinx&rsquo;s documentation</a> on templating. This initially threw me off, so make sure to check which of your template&rsquo;s file must be extended.</p>
<h2 id="enabling-metrics-on-production-build">Enabling metrics on production build</h2>
<p>The <code>enable_plausible</code> variable must be defined for our template above to function. This is done in <code>conf.py</code> file using the <code>html_context</code> variable as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#998;font-style:italic"># conf.py</span>
<span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">import</span> <span style="color:#555">os</span>

<span style="color:#998;font-style:italic"># [...]</span>

READTHEDOCS_VERSION_TYPE <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=</span> os<span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">.</span>environ<span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">.</span>get(<span style="color:#d14">&#34;READTHEDOCS_VERSION_TYPE&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">None</span>)

html_context <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=</span> {
    <span style="color:#d14">&#34;enable_plausible&#34;</span>: READTHEDOCS_VERSION_TYPE <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">in</span> [<span style="color:#d14">&#34;branch&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#d14">&#34;tag&#34;</span>],
}
</code></pre></div><p>I use the <code>READTHEDOCS_VERSION_TYPE</code> environment variable, which is <a href="https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/environment-variables.html#envvar-READTHEDOCS_VERSION_TYPE">set by <em>Read the Docs</em></a>. Its value is <code>&quot;branch&quot;</code> when the docs are built from the main branch, and <code>&quot;tag&quot;</code> when they are built from a tagged release. We want <code>enable_plausible</code> to be set to <code>True</code> in those instances. In any other case, including when <code>READTHEDOCS_VERSION_TYPE</code> is undefined (as is the case for local builds), <code>enable_plausible</code> is set to <code>False</code>.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s about it – these few steps are all it takes more compliant and privacy-friendly metrics thanks to <code>Plausible.io</code>. For a real-world example, you can check my <a href="https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"><em>vpype</em></a> project (<a href="https://github.com/abey79/vpype/pull/546/files">relevant PR</a>).</p>

      <title>TIL: using Sphinx substitutions to generate text snippets from code</title>
      <link>https://bylr.info/articles/2022/09/30/til-sphinx-substitutions/</link>

      <description>Often, technical documentations include lists or other snippets of text that are strongly related to some of the project&amp;rsquo;s code. vpype&amp;rsquo;s documentation is no exception to this.
For instance, the Built-in symbols section lists the units available to expressions:
These units are related to the following piece of code:
# vpype/utils.py UNITS = { &amp;#34;px&amp;#34;: 1.0, &amp;#34;in&amp;#34;: 96.0, &amp;#34;inch&amp;#34;: 96.0, &amp;#34;ft&amp;#34;: 12.0 * 96.0, &amp;#34;yd&amp;#34;: 36.0 * 96.0, &amp;#34;mi&amp;#34;: 1760.0 * 36.</description>

}
</code></pre></div><p>I recently added <a href="https://github.com/abey79/vpype/pull/541">support for more units</a> and, of course, the documentation was at risk of running out of sync. Obviously, generating the list of units based on the code would be a better solution. After some Googling, here is how I did it.</p>
<p>The basic idea is to use <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html#substitutions">substitutions</a>. A substitution consists of assigning a text snippet to a keyword, and subsequently use said keyword (with the <code>|keyword|</code> syntax) in the documentation&rsquo;s body. The second insight is to use the <code>rst_prolog</code> variable (within the <code>conf.py</code> file) for the definition. This being regular Python, the definition can easily be auto-generated based on the original code.</p>
<p>Here is how it looks for the case above:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#998;font-style:italic"># docs/conf.py</span>

<span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">import</span> <span style="color:#555">vpype</span> <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">as</span> <span style="color:#555">vp</span>

<span style="color:#998;font-style:italic"># [...]</span>

UNIT_STRINGS <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=</span> <span style="color:#d14">&#34;, &#34;</span><span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">.</span>join(<span style="color:#d14">f</span><span style="color:#d14">&#34;``</span><span style="color:#d14">{</span>s<span style="color:#d14">}</span><span style="color:#d14">``&#34;</span> <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">for</span> s <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">in</span> <span style="color:#0086b3">sorted</span>(vp<span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">.</span>UNITS<span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">.</span>keys()) <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">if</span> s <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">!=</span> <span style="color:#d14">&#34;in&#34;</span>)

rst_prolog <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=</span> <span style="color:#d14">f</span><span style="color:#d14">&#34;&#34;&#34;
</span><span style="color:#d14">.. |units| replace:: </span><span style="color:#d14">{</span>UNIT_STRINGS<span style="color:#d14">}</span><span style="color:#d14">
</span><span style="color:#d14">&#34;&#34;&#34;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>(Note that <code>in</code> is explicitly excluded from the list because it is a reserved Python keyword and cannot be used in the context of <em>vpype</em> expressions.)</p>
<p>And this is how the substitution is used in the actual documentation file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-rst" data-lang="rst"><span style="color:#999;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">..
</span><span style="color:#999;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">  docs/fundamentals.rst
</span><span style="color:#999;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">
</span><span style="color:#999;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic"></span><span style="color:#099">*</span> Units constants (|units|).<span style="color:#a61717;background-color:#e3d2d2">
</span><span style="color:#a61717;background-color:#e3d2d2">
</span><span style="color:#a61717;background-color:#e3d2d2"></span>  These variables may be used to convert values to CSS pixels unit, which <span style="color:#000;font-style:italic">*vpype*</span> uses internally. For example, the expression <span style="color:#d14">``%(3+4)*cm%``</span> evaluates to the pixel equivalent of 7 centimeters (e.g. ~264.6 pixels). (Note that expressions may overwrite these variables, e.g. to use the <span style="color:#d14">``m``</span> variable for another purpose.)<span style="color:#a61717;background-color:#e3d2d2">
</span></code></pre></div><p><em>Et voilà!</em> Nice and easy. I certainly expect to use this technique often in the future.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following a recent <a href="https://twitter.com/abey79/status/1521484512596746246?s=20&amp;t=3kEAgQUDFiJDRzz77UdTgA">discussion</a> on Twitter, I decided to take yet another deep dive in my Python projects' documentation and fix once and for all the issues I had with it. I first focused on the automatically-generated API reference section and this article details the results of my finding. Specifically, I&rsquo;m using <em>vsketch</em>&rsquo;s <a href="https://vsketch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/vsketch/index.html">API reference</a>, which I recently updated, as an example (<a href="https://github.com/abey79/vsketch/tree/master/docs">documentation source</a>.</p>
<p>This article addresses the following objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Produce a beautiful API documentation based on the code docstrings that is both nice to look at and easy to navigate.</li>
<li>Support for a proper table of content navigation down to each class/module&rsquo;s member.</li>
<li>Nice looking summary tables listing modules' and classes' contents.</li>

<p>This article targets an audience of FOSS maintainers who are unhappy with the state of their project&rsquo;s API documentation, and are frustrated with the process of improving it. A basic understanding of Sphinx as well as an existing documentation setup is assumed. This article basically contains everything I wish I was told when I first started on my API reference improvement journey. For the beginners, I&rsquo;ll provide pointers to help setting up a basic Sphinx.</p>
<p>Note that although this article is structured as a tutorial, it covers tips and techniques which are likely useful for other kinds of documentation customisation.</p>
<h2 id="basic-setup">Basic setup</h2>
<p>As stated above, the basic steps to setup a Sphinx-based documentation project are outside the scope of the present article. I suggest reviewing the following resources to get started:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/mariatta">@Mariatta</a> made a <em>brilliant</em> <a href="https://sphinx-intro-tutorial.readthedocs.io/">tutorial</a> on how to kick-start a Sphinx documentation project.</li>
<li><a href="https://thomas-cokelaer.info">Thomas Cokelaer</a> has a very nice reStructuredText <a href="https://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html">cheat sheet</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://simonwillison.net">Simon Willison</a> wrote another <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2018/Aug/25/restructuredtext/">cheat sheet</a> which covers &ldquo;the subset of reStructuredText worth committing to memory&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Obviously, Sphinx&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/">documentation</a> is an important resource. Although it is somewhat arid for the newcomer, I strongly suggest not giving up on it. I had multiple &ldquo;oh there it is!&rdquo; moments with it in the process of writing this article.</li>
<li>Finally, <a href="https://readthedocs.org">Read the Docs</a> is likely the best place to host your documentation. It&rsquo;s very simple to setup and free for open source projects.</li>

<p>As for the theme, my preference goes for <a href="https://pradyunsg.me">Pradyun Gedam</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo">Furo</a>. I&rsquo;m using it with the default configuration, so the only requirement is to enable it in your <code>conf.py</code> file:</p>

<h2 id="autoapi-setup">Autoapi setup</h2>
<p>After trying both autodoc/autosummary and Sphinx AutoAPI, I opted to use the latter. Here are the main reasons behind this choice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Autosummary does not generate TOC entries for API elements such as classes/modules and their members. This is due to a <a href="https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/6316">long-standing Sphinx limitation</a>. Autoapi works around this limitation (albeit imperfectly, as we&rsquo;ll later note).</li>
<li>Autosummary defaults to <a href="https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/7912">not generating anything</a> and is in my experience frustrating to setup. In contrast, autoapi produces usable output out-of-the-box.</li>
<li>Templates are easier to write thanks to the rich &ldquo;mapper&rdquo; objects AutoAPI provides after parsing your code (see the <a href="#autoapi-objects">AutoAPI objects</a> section below).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that there are two things called &ldquo;autoapi&rdquo; floating on the Internet: the <a href="https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx-autoapi">Sphinx AutoAPI</a> project (<a href="https://sphinx-autoapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">documentation</a>) is the good one. The <a href="https://autoapi.readthedocs.io">other one</a> is unmaintained and barely documented. Make sure you don&rsquo;t loose time dealing with the wrong one.</p>
<h3 id="basics">Basics</h3>
<p>Setting up Sphinx AutoAPI is covered in their <a href="https://sphinx-autoapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html#python">documentation</a>. It boils down to the following steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Install the <code>sphinx-autoapi</code> package:
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ pip install sphinx-autoapi
</code></pre></div></li>
<li>Add AutoAPI it to the Sphinx extension list:
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">extensions <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=</span> [
    <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">...</span>,
    <span style="color:#d14">&#39;autoapi.extension&#39;</span>,
]
</code></pre></div></li>
<li>List your package directories (or the directory containing them) and set basic options:
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">autoapi_dirs <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=</span> [<span style="color:#d14">&#39;../mypackage&#39;</span>]
autoapi_type <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=</span> <span style="color:#d14">&#34;python&#34;</span>
</code></pre></div></li>
<li>Add the generated documentation to your <code>index.rst</code> toctree:
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-rst" data-lang="rst">.. <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">toctree</span>::<span style="color:#a61717;background-color:#e3d2d2">

</span><span style="color:#a61717;background-color:#e3d2d2"></span><span style="color:#999;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">   ...
</span><span style="color:#999;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">   autoapi/index
</span></code></pre></div></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="setting-up-templates">Setting up templates</h3>
<p>We will customise Sphinx AutoAPI&rsquo;s default templates. The easiest is to copy Sphinx AutoAPI&rsquo;s default templates in your project to serve as a starting point.</p>
<p>First, run the following commands (adjusting for your Python version) from your documentation directory:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ mkdir _templates
$ mkdir _template/autoapi
$ cp <span style="color:#008080">$VIRTUAL_ENV</span>/lib/python3.10/site-packages/autoapi/templates/index.rst _templates/autoapi/
$ cp -r <span style="color:#008080">$VIRTUAL_ENV</span>/lib/python3.10/site-packages/autoapi/templates/python _templates/autoapi/ 
</code></pre></div><p>Then, tell Sphinx AutoAPI of its template directory in your <code>conf.py</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">autoapi_template_dir <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=</span> <span style="color:#d14">&#34;_templates/autoapi&#34;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>A useful tip is to make a Git commit just after copying the built-in templates, such that you can track (and revert) your modifications. I&rsquo;ve used this extensively while working on my templates.</p>
<p>At this point, I suggest spending some time to become acquainted with the built-in templates and how they are organised and implemented. If you haven&rsquo;t used it before, it is also useful to review the Jinja2 templating language <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com">documentation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="other-configuration-options">Other configuration options</h3>
<h4 id="autoapi_options"><code>autoapi_options</code></h4>
<p>The <code>autoapi_options</code> controls various aspect of the generated documentation, including the type of class/module members that are listed. Its default value is sensible but I still felt like customising it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">autoapi_options <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=</span> [
    <span style="color:#d14">&#34;members&#34;</span>,
    <span style="color:#d14">&#34;undoc-members&#34;</span>,
    <span style="color:#d14">&#34;show-inheritance&#34;</span>,
    <span style="color:#d14">&#34;show-module-summary&#34;</span>,
    <span style="color:#d14">&#34;imported-members&#34;</span>,
]
</code></pre></div><p>In particular, I want the summary at the top of the module&rsquo;s documentation (<code>show-module-summary</code>), but we will heavily customise it. Check <a href="https://sphinx-autoapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/config.html#confval-autoapi_options">the documentation</a> for a list of available options and their descriptions.</p>
<h4 id="autoapi_keep_files"><code>autoapi_keep_files</code></h4>
<p>Another useful option is <code>autoapi_keep_files</code>. Sphinx-autoapi generates .rst pages for the documentation during the build process, but defaults to deleting them after completion. It&rsquo;s often useful to keep them around for inspection and debugging purposes:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">autoapi_keep_files <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=</span> <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">True</span>
</code></pre></div><h4 id="autodoc_typehints"><code>autodoc_typehints</code></h4>
<p>This is technically an autodoc setting, but Sphinx AutoAPI honours it. It controls if/where type hints are included in the documentation. The possible values are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&quot;signature&quot;</code>: type hints are included in the function signature, which appears first in the member&rsquo;s documentation</li>
<li><code>&quot;description&quot;</code>: type hints are included within the function description, when the arguments are listed</li>
<li><code>&quot;both&quot;</code>: type hints are included in both places</li>
<li><code>&quot;none&quot;</code>: type hints are not included</li>
</ul>
<p>My preference goes for <code>&quot;signature&quot;</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">autodoc_typehints <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=</span> <span style="color:#d14">&#34;signature&#34;</span>
</code></pre></div><h3 id="autoapi-objects">AutoAPI objects</h3>
<p>Understanding the Sphinx AutoAPI objects is key to customising templates. They are one of the major difference with respect to autodoc/autosummary.</p>
<p>In order to generate the API documentation, the autodoc <em>loads</em> your actual code and uses Python&rsquo;s introspection capabilities to extract the required information from your module and class objects. In contrast, Sphinx AutoAPI <em>parses</em> your Python code and builds a collection of so-called &ldquo;mapper&rdquo; objects which describe your code and its structure. These objects are then passed on as context to the Jinja2 templating engine. Oddly, the documentation doesn&rsquo;t provide a reference about them, but their <a href="https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx-autoapi/blob/master/autoapi/mappers/python/objects.py">implementation</a> is easy to read.</p>
<p>Here is a summary of some of the attributes that are useful when writing templates:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>obj.name</code></dt>
<dd>Name of the mapped object, e.g. <code>&quot;MyClass&quot;</code> or <code>&quot;my_method&quot;</code>.</dd>
<dt><code>obj.id</code></dt>
<dd>Fully qualified name of the object, used for cross-referencing, e.g. <code>&quot;my_module.MyClass&quot;</code> or <code>&quot;my_module.MyClass.my_method&quot;</code>.</dd>
<dt><code>obj.summary</code></dt>
<dd>Summary of the object&rsquo;s docstring (i.e. the first line).</dd>
<dt><code>obj.docstring</code></dt>
<dd>Full docstring of the object.</dd>
<dt><code>obj.display</code></dt>
<dd>Indicates whether or not this object should be displayed, based on the options set in <code>conf.py</code> and the result of the <code>autoapi-skip-member</code> event (discussed later).</dd>
<dt><code>obj.children</code></dt>
<dd><em>(Modules and classes only)</em> List children functions, methods, attributes, etc.</dd>
<dt><code>obj.properties</code></dt>
<dd><em>(Functions and methods only)</em> List of properties, such as <code>&quot;classmethod&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;staticmethod&quot;</code>&quot;, <code>&quot;abstractmethod&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;property&quot;</code>, etc.</dd>
<dt><code>obj.obj.args</code></dt>
<dd><em>(Functions and methods only)</em> List of 4-tuples describing the function&rsquo;s arguments. The first item is the star operator if any (<code>&quot;*&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;**&quot;</code>, or <code>None</code>), the second is the argument name, the third is the argument type or <code>None</code>, and the fourth is the argument default value or <code>None</code>. This key piece of data will enable us to recreate the signatures according to our needs.</dd>
</dl>
<p>When working on your documentation, it is often useful to inspect the contents of these mapper objects using a debugger. This can be achieved by adding an handler for the <code>autoapi-skip-member</code> event and setting a conditional breakpoint:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#900;font-weight:bold">skip_member</span>(app, what, name, obj, skip, options):
    <span style="color:#998;font-style:italic"># conditional breakpoint here</span>
    <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">return</span> skip


<span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#900;font-weight:bold">setup</span>(sphinx):
    sphinx<span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">.</span>connect(<span style="color:#d14">&#34;autoapi-skip-member&#34;</span>, skip_member)
</code></pre></div><p>This event will be triggered for every single Python object parsed from your code. By breaking, for example, when <code>obj.name == &quot;my_module&quot;</code>, the <code>obj</code> argument and its children can be fully inspected. I use the following run configuration in my IDE for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Execute module: <code>sphinx.cmd.build</code></li>
<li>Parameters: <code>-M html . _build</code></li>
<li>Working directory: <code>docs/</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="an-autosummary-like-macro">An <code>autosummary</code>-like macro</h2>
<p>By default, Sphinx AutoAPI provides a summary list of classes, functions, and attributes at the top of a module&rsquo;s documentation, which is very nice. Our objective is to add a similar table at the top of each class description, to facilitate navigation. However, Sphinx AutoAPI uses its own <code>autoapisummary</code> directive, which derives from autosummary&rsquo;s <code>autosummary</code> directive. Both suffer from the following limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The way callables are rendered is hard-coded and cannot be customised via templates. In particular, if <code>autodoc_typehints</code> is set to <code>&quot;signature&quot;</code> or <code>&quot;both&quot;</code>, <code>autosummary</code> will include type hints in the summary table as well. Unfortunately, this dramatically increases the length of the signature, which is detrimental to the table layout and usability. Alternatively, signatures can be entirely removed by using the <code>:nosignatures:</code> option. However, in this case, not even parenthesis are displayed, which hides the callable nature of the function. The best compromise is to have the full signature with their arguments, but without typing annotations.</li>
<li>Properties are listed as functions, including their signature. This hides the fact that, API-wise, they behave as data members (though it would still be useful to indicate that they are in fact properties).</li>
<li>There is not indication that a method is abstract, static, or class-based.</li>
</ul>
<p>To address these shortcomings, we will create a <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com">Jinja2</a> template macro to replicate and improve on <code>autosummary</code>/<code>autoapisummary</code> functionality.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Our aim is to create tables where callable have their full – but unannotated – signature, where properties are indicated as such but rendered as attributes, and where static, class, and abstract methods are marked as such. Here is an example of this:</p>

<p>Here is the result I obtain with my project:</p>
<img src="/sphinx-autoapi/basic_class_table.png"alt="Example of basic class table."width="70%"style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"/>
<p>This is a good start, but we&rsquo;re obviously far from the result we want. To start with, no cross-reference links are generated. And, had we passed functions or methods instead of classes to our macro, no signature would have been generated.</p>
<h3 id="custom-labels">Custom labels</h3>
<p>Before fixing our macro, we must discuss these nice looking &ldquo;prop&rdquo;, &ldquo;static&rdquo;, and &ldquo;class&rdquo; tag-like labels in the example tables above. These are implemented using a custom <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/roles.html">role</a> with some CSS attached to it.</p>
<p>This StackOverflow <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/9707879/229511">answer</a> explains how to create a custom role and make it globally available to your documentation. Basically, just add the following to your <code>conf.py</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">rst_prolog <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=</span> <span style="color:#d14">&#34;&#34;&#34;
</span><span style="color:#d14">.. role:: summarylabel
</span><span style="color:#d14">&#34;&#34;&#34;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>role</code> directive creates a new role which can then be used as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-rst" data-lang="rst"><span style="color:#008080">:summarylabel:</span><span style="color:#008080">`My Label`</span><span style="color:#a61717;background-color:#e3d2d2">
</span></code></pre></div><p>Sphinx generates the corresponding HTML code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#000080">span</span> <span style="color:#008080">class</span><span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=</span><span style="color:#d14">&#34;summarylabel&#34;</span>&gt;My label&lt;/<span style="color:#000080">span</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Since it sets an HTML class named after the role, it&rsquo;s easy to adjust the label appearance using some custom CSS. Create a file named <code>_static/css/custom.css</code> in your documentation directory and add the following CSS:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="color:#000080">span</span>.<span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">summarylabel</span> {

<p>Finally, we must tell Sphinx about this CSS file in the <code>conf.py</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">html_css_files <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=</span> [

]
</code></pre></div><h3 id="customising-the-table-appearance">Customising the table appearance</h3>
<p>A similar CSS approach can be used to customise the appearance of the summary table itself. By adding the <code>:class:</code> option to the <code>list-table</code> directive, we can tell Sphinx to attach an HTML class to the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> element, which we can then customise with CSS:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-rst" data-lang="rst">.. <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">list-table</span>:: Title<span style="color:#a61717;background-color:#e3d2d2">

</span></code></pre></div><p>For my project, the only change I made to the default appearance is to force the table to span the entire width regardless of its contents. This can be done by adding the following code to our <code>custom.css</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="color:#000080">table</span>.<span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">summarytable</span> {

</code></pre></div><p>The work is now split in three macros:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>auto_summary()</code></dt>
<dd>This is the &ldquo;public&rdquo; macro. It generates a table based on a list of mapper objects, with an optional title. It iterates over the list of objects, and, for each of them, determines if the signature should be generated (functions and non-property methods) and if some label should be attached. It then uses <code>_item()</code> to generate each object&rsquo;s code.</dd>
<dt><code>_item()</code></dt>
<dd>This helper macro generates the code for each object, prepending a label to the summary if requested.</dd>
<dt><code>_render_item_name()</code></dt>
<dd>This helper macro focuses on generating the properly-cross-referenced object name. If the signature is requested, it iterates over the <code>obj.obj.args</code> list to produce a full (but unannotated) list of arguments.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="improving-the-default-templates">Improving the default templates</h2>
<p>With our <code>auto_summary()</code> macro completed, we are now ready to customise our templates, but we still have one issue to resolve before we do so.</p>
<h3 id="categorising-objects-with-a-custom-jinja2-test">Categorising objects with a custom Jinja2 test</h3>
<p>As we saw in the <a href="#autoapi-objects">AutoAPI objects</a> section, mapper objects representing modules or classes have a <code>children</code> attribute which lists the objects it contains. For example, a module&rsquo;s <code>children</code> attribute lists all the classes, functions and attributes defined within it.</p>
<p>In order to categorise these children into separate sub-lists, the built-in templates heavily use the <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/#jinja-filters.selectattr"><code>selectattr()</code></a> and <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/#jinja-filters.rejectattr"><code>rejectattr()</code></a> filters. For example, a list of classes in a module can be obtained as follows:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>This code selects the visible (but not imported) children from <code>module_object</code>, and then further selects children which have their <code>type</code> set to <code>&quot;class&quot;</code>. In the code above, <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/#jinja-tests.eq"><code>&quot;equalto&quot;</code></a> is known as a Jinja <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/#tests">test</a>. There are many such <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/#builtin-tests">built-in tests</a> in Jinja2.</p>
<p>As stated before, we aim to categorise properties as attributes instead of methods. To that end, we will have to filter methods whose <code>properties</code> attribute contains <code>&quot;property&quot;</code>. Intuition dictates that the following code achieves this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-jinja" data-lang="jinja"><span style="color:#999;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">{%</span> <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">set</span> <span style="color:#008080">property_methods</span> <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=</span>

</code></pre></div><p>The bad news is that no such <code>&quot;contains&quot;</code> test exists by default in Jinja2. The good news is that it is trivial to add one.</p>
<p>First, the actual test must be written. Add the following code to your <code>conf.py</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#900;font-weight:bold">contains</span>(seq, item):
    <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">return</span> item <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">in</span> seq
</code></pre></div><p>Then, we just need to add this test to the Jinja <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/api/#jinja2.Environment">environment</a>. Sphinx AutoAPI provides a hook for that:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#900;font-weight:bold">prepare_jinja_env</span>(jinja_env) <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">-&gt;</span> <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">None</span>:

autoapi_prepare_jinja_env <span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=</span> prepare_jinja_env
</code></pre></div><p>With this in your <code>conf.py</code> file, the template code above will work as expected.</p>
<h3 id="updating-templates">Updating templates</h3>
<p>We previously replaced one of <code>module.rst</code>&rsquo;s use of <code>autoapisummary</code> by our <code>auto_summary()</code> macro (see <a href="#basic-macro-setup">Basic macro setup</a>). It is now time to generalise the use of our macro. At this stage, the details of how this is done is to a large extent up to reader&rsquo;s taste. The <a href="https://github.com/abey79/vsketch/tree/master/docs/_templates/autoapi">templates</a> of <a href="https://github.com/abey79/vsketch">vsketch</a> can serve as fully-functional example and can readily be used in another projects.</p>
<p>For the <code>module.rst</code> template, I have opted to simplify the overview&rsquo;s structure by just generating tables (without headings) for classes, functions, and attributes:</p>

<h3 id="hiding-submodules">Hiding submodules</h3>
<p>Sphinx AutoAPI include all subpackages and submodules recursively, unless those are marked as private by prefixing their name with an underscore. In my packages' <code>__init__.py</code> file, I carefully import from submodules the objects which are meant to be public, but haven&rsquo;t necessarily marked the submodules as private. Sphinx AutoAPI has no option to control whether or not to add them (I <a href="https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx-autoapi/issues/339">suggested</a> adding one), so I had to filter them out manually. This is done with the <code>autoapi-skip-member</code> event handler we mentioned earlier:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#900;font-weight:bold">skip_member</span>(app, what, name, obj, skip, options):

<p>Likewise, it may happen that you want to hide specific members from the documentation without marking them as private. Again, the <code>autoapi-skip-member</code> event handler can do that.

<h3 id="ordering">Ordering</h3>
<p>By default, Sphinx AutoAPI generates the documentation in the same order as the code. This can be <a href="https://sphinx-autoapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/config.html?highlight=ordering#confval-autoapi_member_order">changed</a> to alphabetical order, I like being in control from the code.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/abey79/vsketch"><em>vsketch</em></a>, the top level content is determined by the imports in my package&rsquo;s <code>__init__.py</code> file, so the <code>import</code> statements themself matter. Since I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://pycqa.github.io/isort/">isort</a>, I had to short-circuit it in this particular case:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#998;font-style:italic"># vsketch/__init__.py</span>

</code></pre></div><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Well, this ended up being much longer than anticipated 😅 – if you made it this far, congratulations! 🎉</p>
<p>Here is what we covered:</p>
<ul>
<li>We built on a basic Sphinx project and added AutoAPI to generate an API reference documentation.</li>
<li>We created custom templates based on the built-in templates provided by AutoAPI.</li>
<li>We reviewed the mapper objects created by AutoAPI to described our code.</li>
<li>We learned how to use a debugger to easily inspect these objects.</li>
<li>We crafted an <code>autosummary</code>-like macro named <code>auto_summary()</code> to build beautiful summary tables.</li>
<li>We customised these tables with custom CSS.</li>
<li>We used a custom Sphinx role and CSS to create tag-like labels to be used in the summary tables.</li>
<li>We learned of Jinja2&rsquo;s tests and created a custom one.</li>
<li>We controlled the visibility of submodules and members using a <code>autoapi-skip-member</code> event handler.</li>
<li>We learned how to control ordering from our code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like any software project, improving the documentation is a never-ending endeavour. As it turns out, there is one remaining issue that has been bugging me and is yet unresolved. Due to a limitation in Sphinx, AutoAPI has a tendency to mangle the TOC ordering, especially when section headings are emitted from the templates. Check these <a href="https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx-autoapi/issues/283">two</a> <a href="https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/6316#issuecomment-1066195555">issues</a> for more information. Hopefully they&rsquo;ll get solved in the future.</p>
<p>I shall conclude by stating that, by all means, I do not consider myself a Sphinx expert — much to the contrary. I <em>did</em> spend a lot of time improving my API documentation, and figured it would be wasteful not to share my findings, especially given the relative scarcity of information on advanced Sphinx usage patterns. As a result, it is rather likely that I made mistakes and sub-optimal choices. If so, please do provide feedback, and I&rsquo;ll update this article to improve it.</p>
<p><em>Edit: updated title and intro to clarify the nature of the API discussed, i.e. Python API (2022-05-11).</em></p>

<p>Ideally, these shortcomings would be addressed using an extension and a custom directive, or even by contributing the improvement back to the Sphinx or AutoAPI projects. This is sadly beyond my skills. Also, the template method is anyway useful for highly specific requirements where writing an extension wouldn&rsquo;t be warranted.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

      <title>TIL: aligning horizontal or vertical lines to the pixel grid with OpenGL</title>

      <description>When I started using my new M1 Max MacBook Pro in December, a bunch of vpype&amp;rsquo;s tests started to fail. The failing tests were all image-based: an image is rendered and then compared to a previously-generated, reference image. This process is made easy thanks to this Pytest fixture.
In this case, the reference images were generated long ago on my previous, Intel/AMD-based MacBook Pro. This GIF highlights the discrepancy I&amp;rsquo;d get with images generated on my new computer (notice how the ruler&amp;rsquo;s thickness varies):</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I started using my new M1 Max MacBook Pro in December, a bunch of <a href="https://github.com/abey79/vpype"><em>vpype</em></a>&rsquo;s tests started to fail. The failing tests were all image-based: an image is rendered and then compared to a previously-generated, reference image. This process is made easy thanks to <a href="https://github.com/abey79/vpype/blob/cd95e2da1940171e33ed0001255b763fa0d5f082/tests/conftest.py#L96">this Pytest fixture</a>.</p>
<p>In this case, the reference images were generated long ago on my previous, Intel/AMD-based MacBook Pro. This GIF highlights the discrepancy I&rsquo;d get with images generated on my new computer (notice how the ruler&rsquo;s thickness varies):</p>
<img src="/til-pixel-grid/m1_render.gif"alt="animated gif highlighting rendering discrepancy with horizontal and vertical lines"width="650px"style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"/>
<p>As I&rsquo;m currently working on this viewer again, I finally spent two days tracking this issue – and finally found its cause.</p>
<p>Without giving it a thought, I first used integer coordinates for those ruler lines. However, coordinates refer to pixel <em>boundaries</em> – not pixel <em>centres</em>. This means than an horizontal line with integer coordinates (e.g. <code>[(2, 2), (7, 2)]</code>) sits halfway between two consecutive rows of pixel:</p>
<img src="/til-pixel-grid/pixel_grid.png"alt="schematic of a line not aligned with the pixel grid"width="500px"style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"/>
<p>Which of the 2nd or 3rd row of pixel eventually gets drawn is up to a coin toss – or rather the rounding strategy of your particular OpenGL driver/GPU/OS combination.</p>
<p>By offsetting the coordinates by half a pixel (e.g. <code>[(2, 2.5), (7, 2.5)]</code>), one can force the line on a specific pixel row and avoid any rounding:</p>
<img src="/til-pixel-grid/pixel_grid_aligned.png"alt="schematic of a line aligned with the pixel grid"width="500px"style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"/>
<p>This makes the rendering more predictable across platforms.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the fix was very simple (I just changed the ruler thickness from <code>20</code> to <code>19.5</code>), but figuring it out was tricky (<a href="https://ptb.discord.com/channels/550302843777712148/811289127609827358/960561872774500412">relevant discussions</a> on <a href="https://github.com/moderngl/moderngl">ModernGL</a>&rsquo;s Discord server). Hopefully I wont forget about it after writing this TIL.</p>
