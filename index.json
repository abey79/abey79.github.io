[{"content":"Hello again, world.\nLately, I\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to document some of my personal projects and endeavours, and realised that I lacked an appropriate outlet. I figured this would be great occasion to test Hugo and GitHub Pages and here we are!\nThis is what might ramble about in the future:\n Stuff about vpype, vsketch, and my other plotter-related software projects. Logs for some of my past and future projects (plotter-related or otherwise). Posts related to Home Assistant or other home-automation topics. Who knows what else.  Follow me on Twitter for updates.\n","permalink":"https://bylr.info/articles/2022/02/20/first-post/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHello again, world.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"First post"},{"content":"My name is Antoine Beyeler. I am a multi-disciplinary engineer and entrepreneur with a PhD in flying robotics and interests in software, aviation, photography, generative art, plotters, and home automation. I live in Lausanne, Switzerland 🇨🇭.\nWith a few friends, I co-founded senseFly in 2009, which soon became the leader of fixed-wing mapping drones for surveyors, farmers, humanitarians and many others. Until my departure in 2018, I lead as CTO a team of up to 45 engineers and developed multiple generations of end-to-end mapping drone systems. I am now involved in advisory capacity with several start-ups in the Geneva region.\nLike my skills, my contributions to generative art lean on the technical rather than the artistic side 👨‍💻. Among other things, I created and maintain two open-source projects for plotter generative artists:\n vpype: a Swiss-Army-knife CLI to generate, manage, process, and convert vector graphic files for plotters, vsketch: a Python plotter generative art framework and workflow automation tool.  When I am not at the computer, you may find me piloting a helicopter 🚁 or behind the camera 📷 on my travels.\n","permalink":"https://bylr.info/about/","summary":"My name is Antoine Beyeler.
