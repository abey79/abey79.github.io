[{"content":"My name is Antoine Beyeler. I am a multi-disciplinary engineer and entrepreneur with a PhD in flying robotics and a passion for software, aviation, photography, generative art, and plotters. I live in Lausanne, Switzerland 🇨🇭.\nWith a few friends, I co-founded senseFly in 2009, which soon became the leader of fixed-wing mapping drones for surveyors, farmers, humanitarians and many others. Until my departure in 2018, I lead as CTO a team of up to 45 engineers and developed multiple generations of end-to-end mapping drone systems. I am now involved in advisory capacity with multiple start-ups in the Geneva region.\nLike my skills, my contributions to generative art lean on the technical rather than the artistic side 👨‍💻. Among other things, I created and maintain two open-source projects for plotter generative artists:\n vpype: a Swiss-Army-knife CLI to generate, manage, process, and convert vector graphic files for plotters, vsketch: a Python plotter generative art framework and workflow automation tool.  You may find me piloting a helicopter 🚁 when AFK, or behind the camera 📷 when travelling.\n","permalink":"https://bylr.info/about/","summary":"My name is Antoine Beyeler.
